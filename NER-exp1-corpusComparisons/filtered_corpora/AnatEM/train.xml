      <text>Immunostaining and confocal analysis DNA labelling and staining with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU labelling and detection kit I; Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The nucleoli were detected with an anti-nucleolin antibody (clone 3G4B2; Upstate biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) on cells fixed in 2% formalin for 10 min followed by permeabilization with ice-cold methanol for 30 min. The secondary antibody used for both BrdU and nucleoli staining was a rhodamine (tetra-methyl)-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (T-2762) from Molecular Probe (Eugene, OR). The cells were examined in a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning microscope equipped with a Plan-Apochromate 63x/1.4 oil immersion objective. We used the 488 nm laser line for excitation of EGFP (detected at 505 nm &lt; lambdaEGFP &lt; 530 nm) and the 543 nm laser line for rhodamine (tetra-methyl) (detected at lambdaRhodamine &gt; 560 nm). ECFP fusion protein was excited with a 458 nm laser line (detected at 480 nm &lt; lambdaECFP &lt; 520 nm), EYFP fusion protein was excited with a 514 nm laser line (lambdaEGFP &gt; 560 nm) and HcRed fusion protein was excited with a 543 nm laser line and detected at &gt;585 or 650 nm. The images were from 1 mum thick slices of the cells. The images were exported into Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). </text>

      <text>Results OFTT was given to 33 men with MetS (defined by the Adult Treatment Panel III), 17 HTN and 14 healthy men. The MetS group was further divided according to fasting triglycerides (TG) into TG &gt;= 150 [MetS+TG, (n = 22)] or &lt;150 mg/dl [MetS-TG (n = 11)], and into those with or without hypertension [MetS+HTN (n = 24), MetS-HTN (n = 9), respectively]. TG concentrations were measured before and at 4, 6 and 8 h after OFTT and the postprandial response was quantified using the area under the curve (AUC) for TG. The postprandial response was significantly higher in MetS compared to HTN and healthy men [AUC (SD) in mg/dl/h; 2534 +/- 1016 vs. 1620 +/- 494 and 1019 +/- 280, respectively, p &lt;= 0.001]. The TG levels were increased significantly in MetS+TG compared to MetS-TG subjects at 4 (p = 0.022), 6 (p &lt; 0.001) and 8 hours (p &lt; 0.001). The TG were increased significantly in MetS-TG compared to healthy subjects at 4 (p = 0.011), 6 (p = 0.001) and 8 hours (p = 0.015). In linear regression analysis only fasting TG levels were a significant predictor of the AUC (Coefficient B = 8.462, p &lt; 0.001). </text>

      <text>Conclusions Only after careful consideration of the biological underpinnings of a truly beneficial response can an exposure be considered for the general population, such as the addition of folic acid to cereals. If a toxic or hazardous pollutant were found to have truly beneficial effects at low dose, then that agent should be tested clinically, go through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process, and be regulated as a pharmaceutical for those who might benefit from its use. Certainly, the general population should not be exposed to chemotherapeutic agents that benefit cancer patients. For pharmaceuticals, it is understood that there are trade offs between benefits and risks. For example, although aspirin is a generally well-tolerated pain reliever and is increasingly advocated as a preventative tool for heart attacks and colorectal cancer (Vainio and Miller 2003; Werner et al. 2004), it is also linked to increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, cerebral hemorrhage (Werner et al. 2004), and asthma attacks (Jenkins et al. 2004). In addition, aspirin is not recommended for children or teenagers who have or are recovering from chicken pox or flulike symptoms because it can cause debilitating and sometimes lethal Reyes syndrome (U.S. FDA 2003). Individual risks to pharmaceutical agents can be controlled with proper usage; however, increased exposure to environmental toxins presents additional involuntary risks for the general population. Under the latter condition, exposure is inadequately controlled, and there is no mechanism to correct for individual circumstances (e.g., medical condition or age) that may result in harm. Although hormetic effects may occur in some instances, it is indeed rare that exposures to toxic, mutagenic, teratogenic, and carcinogenic chemicals, even at low exposure levels, would be risk free and provide health benefits for the general public. Portraying chemicals with numerous adverse effects as having benefits while ignoring their hazards is irresponsible and does not provide full and objective disclosure. In the 1950s doctors prescribed DES to pregnant women to prevent miscarriage and premature births and to produce "bigger and stronger babies" even though DES had been shown to cause damage to reproductive tissues in animals (Dinusson et al. 1948; Dunn and Green 1963; Takasugi and Bern 1964). Human use of DES was banned in the United States in 1971 after the discovery of high rates of rare, clear-cell adenocarcinomas of the vagina and cervix in DES-exposed daughters (Herbst 1981), and later studies showed elevated breast cancer risk in women who took DES during pregnancy (Titus-Ernstoff et al. 2001). Certainly, health policy decisions should be based on scientific evidence and not on speculation of health benefits in order for the general population to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past similar to that of the DES tragedy. The claims and projections of health benefits from exposures to environmental toxicants and carcinogens are based on untested assumptions and disregard numerous well-established scientific principles that underpin a public health-protective approach to regulating exposure to toxic substances. If hormesis were used in the decision-making process to allow higher exposures to toxic and carcinogenic agents, this would substantially increase health risks for many, if not most, segments of the general population. </text>

      <text>Results The set of E. coli expression vectors, encode for either a hexa-histidine tag or the three most commonly used solubility tags (GST, MBP, NusA) and all with an N-terminal hexa-histidine sequence. The result is two-fold: the His-tag facilitates purification by immobilised metal affinity chromatography, whilst the fusion domains act primarily as solubility aids during expression, in addition to providing an optional purification step. We have also incorporated a TEV recognition sequence following the solubility tag domain, which allows for highly specific cleavage (using TEV protease) of the fusion protein to yield native protein. These vectors are also designed for ligation-independent cloning and they possess a high-level expressing T7 promoter, which is suitable for auto-induction. To validate our vector system, we have cloned four different genes and also one gene into all four vectors and used small-scale expression and purification techniques. We demonstrate that the vectors are capable of high levels of expression and that efficient screening of new proteins can be readily achieved at the laboratory level. </text>

      <text>Inflammation-modulating effect of antithrombin on the endothelium. Ligation of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) of endothelium with antithrombin (AT) induces cellular signalling events that alter the cell's biochemical and functional responses to inflammatory stimuli (e.g. bacterial lipopolysaccharide [LPS]). Changes include reduced release of inflammatory and procoagulatory mediators (e.g. interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha[TNF]), tissue factor (TF), adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and cellular adhesion molecules (not shown), as well as increased release of anticoagulatory prostacyclin (prostaglandin [PG]I) or CD39/ATPDase. In neuronal tissue, protective mechanisms may by mediated via the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide and nitric oxide with the potential to affect prostacyclin release [55]. </text>

      <text>Background Hallucinations may occur in any sensory modalities. Formed musical hallucinations (i.e. Perception of either vocal or instrumental melodies) reported in English literature to date have typically been associated with marked hearing loss, advanced age, female sex (71%), lack of response to treatment and associated psychopathology [1] but has been concluded that hearing loss is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for the occurrence of musical hallucinations [1]. Tumor like Astrocytoma, Temporal lobe epilepsy, raised intra cranial tension, drug induced (tricyclics, Propronolol etc ;), meningitis and psychotic illness were shown to cause palinacousis and musical hallucinations [2,3]. Musical hallucinations are pseudo hallucinations that originate in memory representations and they may undergo a transition to true hallucination. In musical hallucination spatial projection is less definite. Sometimes they are perceived like the tinnitus in patient's own head. The quality is usually very intense and distinct often very loud. They vary from elementary sounds to instrumental music, vocal music, bird songs, bells, pieces of melodies or sentences, religious music etc:- We report an unusual presentation of an elderly lady who had experienced musical hallucinations whilst being treated with Electro Convulsive Therapy. Though this has never been reported earlier, there seemed to have a good association between the initiation of Electro convulsive therapy and musical hallucination in our patient. </text>

      <text>Conclusion The survey indicated that, the study area has plenty of medicinal plants to treat a wide spectrum of human ailments. Earlier studies on traditional medicinal plants also revealed that the economically backward local and tribal people of Tamil Nadu prefer folk medicine due to low cost and sometimes it is a part of their social life and culture [40-45]. It is evident from the interviews conducted in different villages, knowledge of medicinal plants is limited to traditional healers, herbalists and elderly persons who are living in rural areas. This study also points out that certain species of medicinal plants are being exploited by the local residents who are unaware of the importance of medicinal plants in the ecosystem. This study concluded that even though the accessibility of Western medicine for simple and complicated diseases is available, many people in the studied parts of Kancheepuram district is still continue to depend on medicinal plants, at least for the treatment of some simple diseases such as, cold, cough, fever, headache, poison bites, skin diseases and tooth infections. Well-knowledged healers have good interactions with patients and this would improve the quality of healthcare delivery. The present-day traditional healers are very old. Due to lack of interest among the younger generation as well as their tendency to migrate to cities for lucrative jobs, there is a possibility of losing this wealth of knowledge in the near future. It thus becomes necessary to acquire and preserve this traditional system of medicine by proper documentation and identification of specimens. </text>

      <text>Mass casualty estimation on a geographic basis The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) has expended considerable effort to develop models for calculating mass casualties from a nuclear detonation. In order to specifically evaluate urban medical systems vulnerability we are employing the PC based Consequence Assessment Tool Set (CATS) v6, with ESRI's ArcGIS9 [14], CATS/JACE (Joint Assessment of Catastrophic Events) v5 with ESRI's ArcView 3.3, Hazard Prediction and Assessment Capability (HPAC) V4.04SP3 [15], as well as custom GIS and database software applications. HPAC does excellent Chemical Biological and Nuclear (CBN) modeling, although output could provide more flexibility. Additionally, results can be exported to CATS for further analysis and display. All three programs can access the current weather data from both classified and unclassified weather servers. Examples of uses of CATS/HPAC are hurricane, tidal surge and earthquake damage, prediction of the results from nuclear, biological and chemical releases, assessment of persons and infrastructure affected and at risk (e.g. which hospitals and pharmacies are under a CBN plume and are thus out of commission), and mobilization of surviving and nearby infrastructure outside the plume that would be needed to address healthcare and other emergency response needs of the community. These models have been, and continue to be, developed with a view to better estimating the impact of WMD weapons in an offensive setting. However, recent DTRA enhancements and our modifications have facilitated their use in helping estimate potential casualties from a WMD terrorist incident. One area of intense interest, and somewhat of a vacuum in public health planning, has been the utility of this approach in estimating medical care vulnerabilities in such an attack, and for the calculation of the distribution of surviving medical care resources. While much work has already occurred in estimating the impact of chemical weapons (due to the dual use in chemical spill management from transportation and industrial accidents), or in nuclear power plant accident management, much less research and development has gone into estimating the impact on our civilian population of a nuclear weapon detonation from a terrorist incident in a large urban area. The models already calculate such factors as the impact of blast, thermal effects and fallout, but results are often not available at the detail level needed for civil defense purposes, casualty management, and planning the use of scarce health resources in response to a nuclear weapon detonation. Furthermore, the models do not readily facilitate the calculation of injuries from multiple effects such as burns and blast with fallout or prompt radiation. The complexity of the urban three-dimensional landscape and its local impact on thermal, blast and radiation is also poorly understood. Additionally, given their traditional world-wide focus, and the increased sensitivity to providing information on the U.S.A. of use to terrorists, the models do not provide detailed or current data that exists for the United States that would help provide better casualty estimates and response. The models can be customized locally and data updated if the user has sufficient expertise. However, there is often a significant duplication of effort due to overlapping jurisdictions and the lack of data sharing due to security and other considerations. CATS and HPAC are also useful for creating realistic scenarios for training and planning before a disaster strikes, thus enabling responders to drill and exercise so they know roughly what to expect and how to react. Contingency plans can be created using comprehensive national and more detailed population and infrastructure data. Should disaster strike, the affected population and the impact on critical facilities can be quickly assessed, although efforts frequently need to be expended to ensure regional and local databases are current and useful. </text>

      <text>Case Presentation The patient is an 80 year old male with diabetes mellitus and hypertension, who at age 74 (March 2001) had received a living non-related donor kidney transplant. At that time he was discharged with a double immunosuppressive therapy consisting of prednisone 20 mg/day and mophetil mycophenolate 1.5 gr/day. No calcineurin inhibitor was administered. His prednisone dose was further decreased to 5 mg/day and mophetil mycophenolate doses sustained. In November 2001 he developed cutaneous purple elevated lesions in his lower limbs that were diagnosed as KS by skin biopsy. He received 19 administrations of vincristine (1 mg) and bleomycin (15 mg) weekly that resulted in flattening and fading of the lesions. Treatment was discontinued for two months, and KS recurred, with pain and edema in both legs. On July 2002, with an almost 100% involvement of his lower limbs skin with KS but no visceral involvement he received 50 mg of liposomal-adriamycin. In addition, he was then prescribed valganciclovir 450 mg BID (corrected for creatinine clearance) [7] and three additional administrations of liposomal-adriamycin, up to December 2002. He showed 40% response again with early relapse. On January 2003 the patient developed disseminated herpes zoster, which was treated with IV acyclovir. In May 2003 KS progression was observed and received radiotherapy with no benefit Figure 1. In August 2003 he started oral etoposide at 50 mg QD for two weeks followed by two weeks off until May 2004 achieving a very slow 50% response. Tolerance was good and serum creatinine remain stable at around 1,4 mg/dl. Mophetil mycophenolate dose was reduced to 1 g/day and prednisone to 2.5 mg/day. Figure 1 Kaposi's sarcoma progressions after chemotherapy withdrawal, both lower limbs were completely covered with Kaposi's Sarcoma (June 2003). On May 2004 the patient requested a second opinion and was prescribed Imatinib 200 mg qd for two weeks followed by 400 mg qd. After four weeks of Imatinib, his health deteriorated rapidly, he developed anasarca, worsening of KS, his serum creatinine increased from 1.4 mg/dl to 2.3 mg/dl and he developed grade 4 granulocytopenia (Figure 2). The patient was hospitalized with fever and was started on IV antibiotics and daily G-CSF for four days after which his WBC count normalized. Two weeks later the creatinine level returned to 1.5 mg/dl. On February 2005 he was started on 30 mg of paclitaxel IV every three weeks. After three courses with no clinical benefit he developed a skin rash that prompted discontinuation. Figure 2 Patient developed anasarca with rapid progression of Kaposi's Sarcoma after four weeks of taking Imatinib (June 2004). On April 2005, he was started on Sirolimus 2 mg a day, and after 8 weeks escalated to 4 mg a day. Three weeks later mophetil mycophenolate and prednisone were discontinued. Sustained and significant KS regression was evident after 16 weeks, but he developed a basal cell carcinoma and pneumonia that required hospital admission; Sirolimus dose was lowered to 2 mg a day. Thereafter his clinical course has been satisfactory with continuous and progressive regression of KS lesions (Figure 3). His serum creatinine has remained under 1.6 mg/dl and he has not developed new infectious episodes. Figure 3 Extensive regression of Kaposi Sarcoma after immune-suppression was changed to Sirolimus, (14 months later), he only has hyperpigmented areas at knee levels, skin looks thin and delicate and easily bruised (July 2006). </text>

      <text>Etiology Anorectal malformations (ARM) represent a spectrum of abnormalities ranging from mild anal anomalies to complex cloacal malformations. The etiology of such malformations remains unclear and is likely multifactorial. There are however reasons to believe there is a genetic componenet. As early as the 1950s, it was recognized that there was an increased risk for a sibling of a patient with ARM to be born with a malformation, as much as 1 in 100, compared with the incidence of about 1 in 5000 in the general population. Since that time there have been reports of families with 2 or more affected members and associations of ARMs with multisystem syndromes. In particular, mutations in specific genes encoding transcription factors have been described in patients having Townes-Broks syndrome, Currarino's syndrome, and Pallister-Hall syndrome, each of which have autosomal dominant modes of inheritance. In addition, it has been found that there is not only an increased incidence of ARM in patient with trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome), but that 95% of patients with trisomy 21 and ARM have imperforate anus without fistula, compared with only 5% of all patients with ARM. Based on this evidence, it is likely that the mutation of a variety of different genes can result in ARM, or that the etiology of ARM is multigenic [13]. </text>

      <text>Results The observation that AP-3 is found in both cytosolic and membrane subcellular fractions, and that membrane-associated AP-3 can be extracted with salts (Dell'Angelica et al., 1997a) is consistent with its role as a membrane coat that can be recruited from a cytosolic pool. In addition, the punctate staining of AP-3 by immunofluorescence microscopy, its redistribution to the cytosol by BFA, and the reversibility of the BFA effect (Dell'Angelica et al., 1997a; Simpson et al., 1997) also indicate that AP-3 can cycle between the cytosol and membranes. The sensitivity of AP-3 to BFA in cells suggests that its membrane association may be regulated by ARF1, since BFA inhibits ARF1 guanine nucleotide exchange, and has been shown to prevent ARF1 membrane binding in vitro (Donaldson et al., 1992; Helms and Rothman, 1992; Randazzo et al., 1993).  </text>

      <text>Immunocytochemistry C2C12 cells grown in 8-chamber slides (Nunc) were fixed in 4% PFA/PBS for 10 min and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min. In some cases, they were fixed and permeabilized in methanol at -20degreesC for 2 min. The fixed and permeabilized cells were blocked in PBS containing 3% BSA (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and incubated overnight at 4degreesC with primary antibodies in blocking solution. Immunoreactivity was detected with either Alexa-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) or a combination of biotin-conjugated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) and Alexa-conjugated streptavidin (Molecular Probes). </text>

      <text>Cytology and Histology For semithin sections, embryoid bodies were washed twice in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4degreesC overnight, and after dehydration in ethanol were embedded in JB-4 resin (Polysciences, Inc.). 1-4-mum sections were cut with a glass knife. For cytology, the sections were stained with toluidine blue. In cell mixing experiments, the embryoid bodies were prefixed and stained for beta-galactosidase and the sections were counterstained with neutral red. Teratocarcinomas were fixed in Bouin fixative, embedded in Paraplast, and the sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Microphotography was with a ZEISS Axiomat microscope. Films were scanned and figures were prepared with Photoshop 5.5 software. </text>

      <text>Stimulation/Inhibition of iDC Functions by Activated NK Cells. Two previous studies have shown that both resting and activated NK cells partially kill autologous DCs, as measured by 3-4-h chromium release assays using high NK/DC ratios (11, 12). However, in our long-term cultures (24-48 h) the NK cells stimulated the iDCs rather than lysing them. Based on these conflicting results, we examined in more detail the apparent stimulation of iDCs after contact with NK cells. We reasoned that activated NK cells would be more useful for these experiments because (i) an encounter in vivo between NK cells that normally traffic in the blood (4) and iDCs which reside in the tissues (1, 3), should only occur when both cells are activated; (ii) activated NK cells mediate more potent lysis of iDCs (11-13), thereby allowing for a more rigorous examination of a potential cytotoxic effect; and (iii) the number of NK cells obtained after short-term in vitro culture would be far greater providing more cells for analysis (9). The DC maturation induced by resting NK cells we observed was dependent on endogenous TNF-alpha production. Furthermore, TNF-alpha and other proinflammatory cytokines are important amplifiers of immune responses (14). Therefore, we used TNF-alpha production as a readout for DC stimulation in our culture system. Culturing activated NK cells with DCs at low NK/DC ratios (1:5) led to increases in TNF-alpha production, which were augmented dramatically by the addition of suboptimal doses (10 ng/ml) of LPS (Fig. 2 A). The increased TNF-alpha production was dependent on cell-to-cell contact because when the two cell types were separated in trans-wells, no stimulation was observed (Fig. 2 B). In separate experiments we observed this NK-stimulatory effect on TNF-alpha production at NK/DC ratios as low as 1:20 and 1:40 (data not shown). Raising the NK/DC ratio to 5:1 changes the interaction from one of potent DC stimulation to that of complete inhibition in the presence or absence of LPS (Fig. 2 C). An identical pattern is seen for IL-12 p40 production (Fig. 2 D). No IL-10 production in the cultures was detected under any of the conditions tested (data not shown). The massive production of TNF-alpha in the cultures at the lowest ratios was mediated primarily by DCs in the culture due to the low number of NK cells (2 x 104 cells per well) used in these experiments. In addition, efforts to stimulate NK cells directly with optimal doses of anti-CD16, rIL-2, rIL-12, and PMA/ionomycin alone or in combination induced only moderate (&lt;500 pg/ml) TNF-alpha production by the NK cells alone which were present at 2 x 105 cells per well (data not shown). Figure 2. Activated/cultured NK cell-mediated amplification/inhibition of DC cytokine production. Results are presented on log scales. Cultured iDCs were incubated alone or with cultured/purified NK cells for 24 h (A and B) or 48 h (C-E) in the presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of LPS. After culture the supernatants were removed and analyzed by ELISA for TNF-alpha or IL-12 p40. (A) TNF-alpha production was measured in the supernatants from cultures of: DCs alone (gray bars); NK+DC (1:5) (black bars). LPS concentrations used were: 0, 10, and 1,000 ng/ml (DCs alone only). (B) Contact-dependent stimulation of iDC TNF-alpha production by NK cells was tested under the following conditions: DCs alone (gray bars); NK+DC (1:5) (black bars); NK/DC (1:5) trans-wells (striped bars). LPS concentrations used were: 10 ng/ml (donor 1) and 20 ng/ml (donor 2). (C and D) Effect of increasing the NK/DC ratio (DCs alone; NK:DC-1:5; 1:1; 5:1) on (C) TNF-alpha and (D) IL-12 p40 production. LPS concentrations used were: 0 ng/ml (*); 20 ng/ml (*); 50 ng/ml (^); and 1,000 ng/ml-LPS (*) (DCs alone only). (E) The effect of neutralizing IFN-gamma production was tested under the following conditions: DCs alone (gray bars); NK+DC (1:5) (black bars); NK+DC (1:5) and 10 mug/ml of blocking anti-IFN-gamma mAb (stippled bars). LPS concentrations used were: 0 ng/ml (NO LPS) and 20 ng/ml (LPS 20). Blocking reagents for CD80, CD86, CD154, CD95, CD11a, CD50, or IL-12, had no effect on the NK cell-induced TNF-alpha or IL-12 p40 production, whereas a neutralizing antibody for IFN-gamma while not affecting TNF-alpha production partially blocked (&lt;20%) IL-12 p40 production induced by the NK cells (Fig. 2 E). This partial inhibition is consistent with numerous previous reports demonstrating a central role for an IL-12/IFN-gamma positive feedback loop active between NK cells and IL-12-producing cells (15-17). Clearly, however, this well-described cytokine cross-talk mechanism is secondary to the contact-dependent activation of DCs by NK cells described here. Taken together these results indicate that novel mechanisms control cognate interactions between NK cells and DCs and that NK-DC contact has the potential to serve as an important control switch for both amplifying and attenuating innate immune responses in vivo. We next tested directly whether NK cell killing was active in our system using both short-term (4-h) chromium release assays (data not shown) and a flow cytometric assay which allowed us to follow the survival of the autologous iDCs in the presence of NK cells over longer periods (Fig. 3). The results demonstrate that NK cells kill autologous iDCs (Fig. 3 A) at all NK/DC ratios tested after 4 h and the level of killing is similar to the lysis of K562 cells over the same time (Fig. 3 B). After 24 h, however, the presence of NK cells led to completely divergent effects on the DCs. At the 5:1 (NK/DC) ratio, NK cell-mediated destruction of the iDCs was the dominant feature, whereas at the low ratio (1:5) the same NK cells promoted iDCs survival compared with iDCs alone over the same period (Fig. 3 A). The equal ratio of NK/DC (1:1) fell between these two extremes. The NK cell-mediated lysis of the K562 targets increased at all ratios tested after the 24-h incubation. These striking differences between death and survival of DCs upon encountering NK cells correlate precisely with our previous results on TNF-alpha and IL-12 p40 production where increasing numbers of NK cells in the culture shifts the NK effect from potent stimulation to complete inhibition (Fig. 2). Figure 3. Activated/cultured NK cell-mediated death/survival of DCs and NK-DC conjugate formation. NK cell mediated killing/survival of CFDA.SE-loaded iDCs (A) and K562 cells (B) was measured by flow cytometry over 4 h (*) or 24 h (*) at the indicated NK/DC ratios as described in Materials and Methods. Results are presented as percentage of specific lysis +/- SEM (n = 3 independent experiments). NK-DC (C-E) or NK-K562 (F-H) conjugate formation was measured by flow cytometry, at the following ratios (NK/DC or NK/K562): 1:5 (C and F); 1:1 (D and G); and 5:1 (E and H). Snarf-1 (FL3)-labeled iDCs or K562 cells were incubated (30 min) with CFDA.SE (FL1)-labeled NK cells at the different ratios. The percentage of conjugates formed (top right quadrant) was calculated by determining the percentage of FL3+ (Snarf-1) events which were also positive for FL1 (CFDA.SE). The results are representative of four experiments performed with activated NK cells. Resting NK cells also readily formed conjugates with autologous iDCs (data not shown). NK cells can both efficiently kill and potently stimulate DCs in our model system and each of these opposing effects appear dependent on cell-to-cell contact. To quantify these apparent cognate interactions we measured the formation of NK-DC conjugates and compared them to conjugates formed by NK cells and tumor targets. Our analysis revealed that NK cells bound DC (Fig. 3 C-E) with an efficiency almost equal to that of NK cell binding to the classical NK-target, K562 (Fig. 3 F-H). Binding was detectable even at the lowest NK/DC ratio tested (1:5) indicating that NK-DC conjugates are formed in our other experiments measuring cytokine production and cell killing. Our initial experiments using resting NK cells (Fig. 1) demonstrated a contact-dependent NK effect driving iDCs to mature. Therefore, we tested what effects activated NK cells mediated on DC maturation (Fig. 4). Similar to our previous results with activated NK cells (Figs. 2 and 3), addition of NK cells to the culture leads to opposing effects on the iDC population depending on the NK/DC ratio. Compared with the untreated DCs (Fig. 4 A-C), low NK/DC ratios (1:5 or 1:1) consistently augmented expression of the maturation markers: CD86 (Fig. 4 D-I), CD83, and HLA-DR (data not shown). At a 5:1 ratio (NK/DC) most of the DCs are nonviable (Fig. 4 J-L). Addition of suboptimal doses of LPS (Fig. 4 C, F, I, and L) augmented the NK-induced maturation at NK/DC ratios of 1:5 and 1:1, but had no effect at the 5:1 ratio. Again, DC maturation was dependent on NK cell contact and endogenously produced TNF-alpha, because it did not occur when the two cell types were separated in trans-wells or upon the addition of a neutralizing antibody for TNF-alpha (Fig. 5). Moreover, addition of blocking reagents for CD80, CD86, CD154, CD95, CD11a, CD50, IL-12, IFN-gamma, IFN-alpha, or IFN-beta had no effect on the NK-induced maturation (data not shown). Figure 4. Activated/cultured NK cell-mediated maturation/death of DCs. Cultured iDCs were incubated for 48 h, alone (A-C), or with NK cells at the following ratios (NK/DC), 1:5 (D-F), 1:1 (G-I), and 5:1 (J-L). Forward versus side scatter plots (A, D, G, and J) show the gating on the DC subset and demonstrate its disappearance at the 5:1 (NK/DC) ratio (J). Propidium iodide staining of the NK/DC (5:1) cultures confirmed the almost complete absence of viable DCs (data not shown). Staining for CD86 expression was performed as described in Fig. 1 and the histograms are shown for DCs cultured in the presence (C, F, I, and L) or absence (B, E, H, and K) of 1 ng/ml of LPS. Results are representative of six experiments performed. Figure 5. Activated/cultured NK cell-induced DC maturation is dependent on cell-to-cell contact and endogenous TNF-alpha production. Cultured iDCs were incubated alone (A, D, and G); with activated NK cells at an NK/DC ratio of 1:5 (B, E, and H); with activated NK cells (NK/DC; 1:5) separated in trans-wells (C and F); or with activated NK cells and 10 mug/ml of a neutralizing antibody for TNF-alpha (I). LPS concentrations used were: 0 ng/ml (A-C); 10 ng/ml (D-F) and 50 ng/ml (G-I). CD86 staining of the DC subset was performed as in Figs. 1 and 4. Results are representative of four experiments performed. </text>

      <text>Background Potato late blight, a disease caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans, is one of the world's most devastating crop diseases. World-wide losses due to late blight exceed several billion dollars annually [1]. Most of the potato cultivars currently grown in the United States are highly susceptible to late blight and control of this disease relies almost exclusively on fungicide applications. The most effective and environmentally sound way for controlling late blight is to incorporate natural resistance into potato cultivars. The pedigrees of many potato cultivars currently used in different countries include late blight resistant germplasm derived from Solanum demissum, Solanum andigena, and other wild species. However, most of the resistance derived from these wild species is controlled by single dominant resistance genes (R genes). These R genes are only effective in preventing the development of late blight if the invading P. infestans race contains the corresponding avirulence genes. This R gene-mediated resistance is often short-lived and is rapidly overcome by new races of the late blight pathogen. Solanum bulbocastanum (2n = 2x = 24) is a diploid species that has adapted in the same environment as the late blight pathogen. This wild species was characterized as possessing durable resistance against P. infestans, even under high disease pressure [2,3]. Two resistance genes, RB (Rpi-blb1) and Rpi-blb2, have been cloned from S. bulbocastanum [4-6]. Both genes confer broad-spectrum resistance against a wide range of known P. infestans races. Transgenic potato lines containing a single RB gene showed a high-level resistance in the Toluca Valley, Mexico, where the potato fields are naturally intensively infested with the most diversified P. infestans populations [7]. Most interestingly, transgenic RB plants did not show total immunity to late blight, but instead showed a marked delay in both onset of symptoms and development of lesions. Such rate-limiting resistance may put less selection pressure on the P. infestans populations and protect the durability of this resistance gene. The RB gene therefore provides an excellent model to study the mechanism of broad-spectrum and rate-limiting disease resistances. An understanding of the underlying mechanism of this type of resistance is important for developing strategies to breed durable and sustainable disease resistance. Several genes have been implicated in the regulation of R gene function. Of these genes, Rar1 and Sgt1 are among the most extensively studied genes. The Rar1 (required for Mla12 resistance) gene was first identified for its essential role in the function of a subset of Mla genes that confer resistance to barley powdery mildew [8]. The RAR1 protein contains two highly similar but distinct cysteine- and histidine-rich (CHORD) Zn2+-binding domains and was proposed to play a role in stabilizing R proteins in a confirmation that is implicated in receiving pathogen signals [9]. The Sgt1 gene (suppressor of the G2 allele of skp1) is an essential gene with multiple functions in yeast. SGT1 protein was initially identified as a RAR1-interacting partner in a yeast two-hybrid screen [10]. SGT1 may play a role in R protein accumulation [11]. Rar1 and Sgt1 genes are required in various R-gene mediated resistance against viral, bacterial, oomycete or fungal pathogens [12]. However, none of the previously studied R genes showed a race-non-specific and rate-limiting resistance phenotype as the RB gene. In addition, the role the Rar1 and Sgt1 genes are not universal and these genes are not essential for resistance involving some R genes [12,13]. Besides the two broad-spectrum resistance genes RB and Rpi-blb2, several race-specific late blight resistance genes have also been cloned [14-16]. Numerous late blight resistance genes have recently been mapped in various potato species or populations [17-25]. However, there is almost no information available about the resistance pathways mediated by any of these genes. As an initial effort to understand the RB-mediated late blight resistance pathway, we silenced the Rar1 and Sgt1 genes using an RNAi-based approach in a potato line containing the RB gene. We demonstrated that SGT1, but not RAR1, is essential for the RB-mediated broad-spectrum resistance to potato late blight. </text>

      <text>Ovariectomy Based on the uterine weight, we determined seven unsuccessful OVXs. The rats concerned were removed from further analyses, which left nine rats in the control group, five in the OVX group, seven in the OVX and late ZOL group, and eight in the OVX and early ZOL group. For each animal, we determined the percentage change in structural parameters compared to the values at week 0. Figure 1 shows the average percentage change and upper standard deviation for all groups for BV/TV, Conn.D, SMI, Tb.N, Tb.Th, and Tb.Sp. The OVX group without treatment showed large changes in structural parameters, indicating the development of OVX-induced bone loss (Figs. 1 and 2). Paired Student's t-test indicated significant changes within 2 weeks after OVX for all structural parameters. BV/TV, Conn.D, and Tb.N decreased during the experiment and SMI and Tb.Sp increased. Both Tb.Th and Tb.N decreased within 2 weeks, indicating that both thinning and complete resorption of trabeculae started directly after OVX. The initial rapid loss of bone and connectivity was largely accompanied by trabecular thinning, while secondary, slower loss of bone was concomitant with a decrease in Tb.N. While BV/TV, Conn.D, SMI, Tb.N, and Tb.Sp showed continuous changes in the same direction throughout the experiment, Tb.Th initially decreased significantly until 4 weeks after OVX and then increased again until after 16 weeks Tb.Th was significantly higher than in the control group.  Fig. 1 Average percentage change in structural parameters in the metaphyseal proximal tibia and upper standard deviation for all groups at all time points. Brackets indicate P &lt; 0.05 at week 16 Fig. 2 Same slice of an unprocessed CT scan of the same rat in the OVX group taken at weeks 0 (a), 2 (b), 4 (c), 8 (d), 12 (e), and 16 (f). Images show typical trabecular bone loss due to OVX in the metaphysis. Green line shows the analyzed metaphyseal bone The absolute average values and standard deviations for all structural parameters of all measurements are shown in Table 1. At the starting point, some differences in the values between the groups were present. This was due to the fact that some animals, which mostly had a relatively low BV/TV, were removed from the study because they did not respond to the OVX. However, since we compared the relative changes in each animal, the results were most likely not affected by the difference in absolute values.

      <text>3. Results and discussion AbsC was overexpressed and purified with a final yield of approximately 10 mg of protein from 1 l culture and was judged to be greater than 98% pure by SDS-PAGE analysis. The DLS analysis after gel filtration showed a monomodal distribution, with a polydispersity value of 18.9% and a molecular-size estimate of 39.6 kDa. This was comparable to the value of 36 kDa estimated from the calibrated gel-filtration column, strongly suggesting that AbsC exists as a homodimer in solution (calculated molecular weight of 41.0 kDa for the His-tagged dimer), in agreement with other characterized MarR homologues. Preliminary crystals grew within 24 h at 293 K from several different crystallization conditions. Improved crystals were subsequently obtained with a precipitant solution consisting of 1 M ammonium sulfate, 0.55 M potassium sodium tartrate in 100 mM citrate pH 5.6, giving crystals with approximate dimensions of 700 x 50 x 50 microm (Fig. 1 &gt;). Native X-ray data were collected from a single AbsC crystal: a total of 214 x 0.4degrees oscillation images were recorded in a continuous sweep to a maximum resolution of 2.25 A. Indexing was consistent with a primitive orthorhombic lattice, with unit-cell parameters a = 43.53, b = 121.30, c = 143.75 A. After processing the data in space group P222, pseudo-precession plots were analysed using HKLVIEW (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994 &gt;) and the systematic absences were indicative of space group P212121. Reprocessing in this space group yielded a data set that was 95.6% complete to 2.25 A resolution. Data-collection statistics are summarized in Table 1 &gt;. Estimation of the content of the asymmetric unit (ASU) suggested that three or four His-tagged AbsC subunits were most likely, giving solvent contents of 60.3% or 47.0% and crystal-packing parameters (V M) of 3.09 or 2.32 A3 Da-1, respectively. Given that both DLS and gel filtration suggest that AbsC is dimeric and that MarR homologues exist as homodimers (Wilkinson &amp; Grove, 2006 &gt;), an even number of subunits per ASU, i.e. four, would seem to be the most probable (Matthews, 1968 &gt;). A Patterson function calculated on data in the resolution range 10.0-3.0 A revealed a significant peak (at 24% of the origin peak) with a vector of u = 0.0, v = 0.5, w = 0.014, indicating that one or more molecules in the ASU were similarly orientated. A self-rotation function calculated on data in the resolution range 10.0-5.0 A using MOLREP (Vagin &amp; Teplyakov, 2000 &gt;) did not show any clear noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS), perhaps suggesting that if NCS axes were present they were parallel (or almost parallel) to crystallographic axes. Fold prediction, based on the amino-acid sequence of AbsC, was performed using the FUGUE server (http://www-cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk/~fugue/prfsearch.html; Shi et al., 2001 &gt;). This found eight 'certain' hits, with the top three being MarR (PDB code 1jgs; Z score 21.4; 18% sequence identity), SlyA (PDB code 1lj9; Z score 18.4; 16% sequence identity) and YusO (PDB code 1s3j; Z score 15.7; 16% sequence identity). All three hits were used as search models for molecular replacement in the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994 &gt;), but none yielded plausible solutions against the 2.25 A resolution native data set, although this is not too surprising given their very low sequence identities. Thus, we will need to solve the AbsC structure by isomorphous replacement methods. To this end, we are preparing selenomethionine-labelled protein; there are a total of seven methionine residues present in the 158-amino-acid sequence of AbsC. </text>

      <text>Peptide-BSA conjugates as diagnostic antigens To analyse the potential of the peptides to behave as antigen mimics, their ability to react with IgM antibodies from individuals infected with EBV was assessed. In our previous study, we demonstrated that the sensitivity of detection was greatly improved when the peptides were coupled to a carrier molecule such as BSA prior to immobilisation onto a solid surface (Casey et al., 2006). This strategy was adopted to test peptides Eb1-4 and H1. A set of 40 clinical samples that were classified as EBV seropositive (n = 16), seronegative (n = 16) or potentially cross-reactive sera (n = 8) were assessed for reactivity with Eb1-4 and H1 peptides individually. The cut-off level was defined as the mean optical density of the seronegative samples plus 3 standard deviations shown as a line on the graphs in Fig. 5. Readings above this level were defined as positive and below this level negative. The same set of samples were analysed on BSA alone and these values were subtracted from the peptide-BSA conjugate readings and the corrected absorbance readings were plotted individually for our new peptides Eb1-4 and H1 in Fig. 5. There was a clear difference in the detection of seropositive antibodies by all the peptides (Fig. 5A-E) compared with the analysis of BSA alone (Fig. 5F), with the majority of absorbance readings above the cut-off level. We compared the ability of our panel of peptide mimotopes to be recognised by antibodies in the same set of seropositive samples in Fig. 6A and the sensitivity of detection is shown in Fig. 6B. We also included F1 and Gp125 mimotopes specific for two mAbs in our previous study (Casey et al., 2006). Of the peptides identified from polyclonal sera Eb1, Gp125 and F1 had the highest sensitivity (94%). Slightly lower sensitivity was observed for Eb2, 3 and 4 (88%) and H1 peptide had the lowest sensitivity (81%) as summarised in Fig. 6B. The sensitivity of F1 and Gp125 was similar to that produced by the mimotopes selected in our previous study, 95% for F1 and 92% for Gp125. Fig. 5 Evaluation of peptides Eb1-4 and H1 coupled to BSA as EBV diagnostic reagents. Human serum (n = 40) previously analysed using a diagnostic test for VCA IgM was allowed to react with the peptides and the bound IgM antibodies were detected using anti-human IgM HRP. The absorbance readings for 1 (positive), 2 (negative) and putative cross-reactive sera for 3 (Parvo), 4 (HSV), 5 (CMV) and 6 (RF) are plotted for (A) Eb1, (B) Eb2, (C) Eb3, (D) Eb4, (E) H1 and (F) BSA, respectively. The cut-off value is defined as the mean of the negative population +3SD indicated by a solid horizontal line; since there were no false positives, the specificity for each mimotope was 100%. Fig. 6 Comparison of the reactivities of our panel of mimotopes Eb1-4, H1, F1 and Gp125 conjugated to BSA with EBV IgM-positive sera (n = 16) absorbance values are plotted and the cut-off levels are depicted by a horizontal line in (A). (B) Summary of the false-negative results from the 5/16 serum samples seropositive for IgM EBV and the overall sensitivity for each mimotope for diagnosis of EBV IgM antibodies. We also considered which seropositive EBV samples contained antibodies that did not recognise the panel of peptides, i.e. false-negative readings, listed in Fig. 6B. The antibodies in serum 1 (s1) were unreactive with all of the peptides identified in this study, s2 was not reactive with Eb3, Eb4 and H1 and s3 was unreactive with H1. Gp125 and F1 that were selected in our previous study were recognised by s1, 2 and 3; however, two different serum samples (s4 and 5) did not recognise F1 or Gp125, respectively. This demonstrates that individual peptides are not recognised by all EBV antibodies and confirms that different peptides are required to represent different epitopes. Therefore, a combination of Eb1 peptide F1 and Gp125 peptides could be recognised by antibodies present in all this set of EBV clinical samples resulting in 100% sensitivity. For the samples defined as EBV-seronegative, there were no readings above the cut-off level and therefore no false positives, resulting in 100% specificity. In addition, there were no absorbance readings above the cut-off levels for the potentially cross-reactive serum samples, inferring that the peptides identified in this study have high specificity for EBV antibodies. </text>

      <text>Nucleotide features of free-standing homing-endonucleases Gene control elements were identified for several members of each type of intervening homing endonuclease genes described in this study. In 15 out of 16, 5' untranslated regions of the endonucleases we identified RNA hairpin structures upstream of initiation codons (Figures 1 and 4A). This may be a translational regulatory hairpin structure known from various phage genes, including homing endonucleases (22,47-49). The hairpins we found are in fractured gene loci with different protein host types, including gp41, IMPDH, DnaE, NrdJ and NrdA. Ten of these hairpins also include a conserved sequence of Aeh1 phage late promoter element (TATAAATA), which was recently shown to inhibit the translation of a gene-fracturing endonuclease gene, by sequestering its ribosome binding site (22,23). Analysis of the endonuclease 5' untranslated regions revealed two conserved motifs (Figures 4A and Supplementary Figure S4), which usually complement each other on the stem of the conserved hairpin structures.  Figure 4. Nucleotide features of endonuclease genes. (A) RNA hairpin structures at the 5' untranslated region of endonuclease ORFs in the gp41-1 (representing the very similar sequences of gp41-1-7), nrdA-5 and DnaE-1 gene loci. Initiator codons are marked by arrows, conserved putative T4 late promoter elements are boxed, and conserved sequence motifs (Supplementary Figure S4) are highlighted in grey. The expected values for motifs 1 and 2 are 1.7-10 and 9.9-3, respectively. RNA structures were calculated using the Vienna package (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAfold.cgi), and sequence motifs were identified using the MEME program. (B) Overlapping#protein coding regions of endonuclease 3' termini and the 5' termini of their downstream genes. Additionally, 15 loci included an overlapping region of 6-69 bp between the coding regions of the probable endonuclease C-termini and the downstream N-termini of the split-intein part (Figures 1 and 4B). This overlap is present in both types of endonucleases, and is independent on the presence of a split-intein part in the fractured gene, also occurring in the putative sbcD DNA-repair gene that we found, as well as in the Aeh1 fractured nrdA found by Gibb and Edgell (22). </text>

      <text>Discussion Because Netherton syndrome exhibits allergic phenotype, it is reasonable to speculate that SPINK5, which is mutated in Netherton syndrome, may act as a candidate gene for asthma and other allergic diseases [9]. An extensive search for single nucleotide polymorphisms in the SPINK5 led to the identification of a number of SNPs, including six nonsynonymous SNPs in coding region that might perturb its immune function. Subsequent genotyping of three nonsynonymous SNPs, A1103G, G1156A and G1258A in two independent panels of British families showed a significant association between SNP G1258A (Glu420Lys) and atopy, atopic dermatitis, elevated serum IgE levels and asthma [10]. This association was confirmed in a large German population and two Japanese populations [16-18]. Kato et al analyzed eight SNPs in exon 13 and 14 of the SPINK5 including G1258A (Glu420Lys), and found a positive association of seven SNPs with atopic dermatitis in a Japanese study sample using a case-control study design [16]. Nishio et al surveyed five of six previously reported nonsynonymous SPINK5 SNPs in Japanese atopic families identified through asthmatic children or subjects with atopic dermatitis and found that SPINK5 was associated with development of atopic dermatitis but not asthma [17]. Kabesch M et al. analyzed G1258A (Glu420Lys) in a German population of school children, and found its association with asthma as well as a concomitant occurrence of asthma and atopic dermatitis [18]. However, two subsequent studies failed to replicate the original SPINK5 findings for allergic diseases [19,20]. Folster-Holst et al genotyped four nonsynonymous SNPs (Asp106Asn, Asn368Ser, Asp386Asn, and Glu420Lys), and detected no association between SPINK5 and atopic dermatitis in populations of Northern German origin [20]. Jongepier H et al. failed to detect any association between SPINK5 and asthma, atopic phenotypes and atopic dermatitis in a Dutch population [19]. These discordant findings probably reflect different genetic and environmental backgrounds in various populations. To determine whether nonsynonymous SNPs of the SPINK5 are involved in the pathogenesis of asthma in the Chinese Han population, we performed a case-control study by genotyping four nonsynonymous SNPs in the SPINK5. We did not detect any significant association between these nonsynonymous SNPs and asthma in our Chinese samples. With our sample size, we expected a power of at least 80% in detecting an effect of OR &gt;=1.3 for each of these SNPs. Therefore, our failure to detect an association for these 4 SNPs was not due to the sample size. These results suggest that the polymorphisms in the coding region of the SPINK5 are unlikely to contribute to asthma risk in the Chinese Han population. However, because our patients were ascertained for asthma, we could not exclude a role of the coding SNPs of the SPINK5 in atopic dermatitis in our population. The variations in the regulatory sequences of genes may determine risks to common diseases by causing different levels of expression. Therefore, the identification and functional evaluation of polymorphisms in promoter region are of great value in understanding the genetic susceptibility to asthma. In order to determine the role of the SPINK5 promoter polymorphism in the pathogenesis of asthma, we genotyped a promoter polymorphism, -206G&gt;A, in 422 asthma patients and 410 controls, and found a marginal association. The frequency of allele G was significantly higher in asthmatic patients than that in controls (p = 0.022). To confirm the association, additional 267 asthma patients and 301 controls newly recruited from the same hospital were genotyped, and the -206G&gt;A polymorphism remained significantly associated with asthma (P = 0.001), even after Bonferroni correction(adjusted P = 0.01). To our knowledge, this is the first report of an association of -206G&gt;A polymorphism with asthma. We further examined the potential functional role of this promoter polymorphism, and found that the G to A substitution at -206 generated a GATA-3 transcription factor binding site. Major transcription factors controlling Th1 and Th2 development, such as T-box transcription factor and GATA3, are possibly involved in asthma and atopic diseases. GATA-3, a transcription factor specifically expressed in T helper 2 (Th2) cells, plays a critical role in the differentiation of Th2 cells from uncommitted CD4+ lymphocytes. In addition, GATA-3 is essential for the expression of the cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 that mediate allergic inflammation [23]. Our luciferase reporter assay confirmed that SNP -206G&gt;A is associated with the transcriptional activity of SPINK5. The G allele was associated with decreased transcriptional activity of the SPINK5. The mechanism by which the -206G&gt;A SNP affects SPINK5 expression may be explained by the potential differential transcription factor binding of GATA binding factor, since -206G&gt;A is located at the core sequence of GATA binding factor binding site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirmed that the A to G substitution at -206 significantly reduced the binding efficiency of nuclear proteins to this element. Our data suggest that loss of GATA transcription factor regulation with the -206G may decrease the SPINK5 expression and thereby potentially perturb the immunosuppressive function of LEKTI. </text>

      <text>Chicken CCN3 expression in embryonic and extraembryonic tissues Expression of CCN3 in axial structure becomes visible in the presegmentation stage and reaches to the highest level at the beginning of somitogenesis (HH stage 7, Fig. 1a). Strong similarity between CCN3 and Sonic Hedgehog was observed for the expression pattern in axial structure (notochord and floor plate), in which the left-right asymmetrical pattern in the node area is also conserved (Fig. 1b). However, Sonic Hedgehog expression is slightly broader than that of CCN3. Since CCN3 stimulates Notch signaling (Sakamoto et al. 2002), we investigated the expression of Notch signal genes. Among them, Serrate1, a ligand of Notch is unique because its expression is apparently a right deviated pattern in the node area (Fig. 1c). Another Notch ligand, Delta1 shows a right deviated pattern, but is more caudal area of the node extending to the primitive streak (data not shown). The expression of CCN3 in axial structure was followed by the presomitic mesoderm although it is diminished (Sakamoto et al. 2002).  Fig. 1 Expression of mRNA in early stage chicken embryo; CCN3 (a), Sonic Hedgehog (b) and Serrate1 (c) at the beginning stage of somitogenesis (Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) Stage 7). Arrowheads indicate Hensen's node. Demonstrates the schematic view of tissue organization at this stage (d). Expression of CCN3 mRNA in blood islands of chicken extraembryonic tissue (HH stage 10) (e). Ventral part of the endothelial precursor cells in blood islands is positive for CCN3 expression. Coloration was stopped before the background staining started in sense probes (negative control) There is accumulating evidence of CCN3 commitment to hematopoiesis and therefore we investigated the CCN3 expression in extraembryonic tissues. Blood islands are formed in the yolk sac mesodermal area just between the visceral endodermal and ectodermal layers, which supply the red blood cells at the primary stage. The cells in blood islands are called hemangioblasts since they also differentiate into the endothelial cells of extraembryonic blood vessel structure. In chicken embryo, differentiating endothelial cells in the ventral part of blood islands express CCN3 from the initial stage (Fig. 1e). Erythroblasts in the center of blood islands (spherical cells in Fig. 1e) weakly express CCN3 and their expression is mildly enhanced in later stage (data not shown). </text>

      <text>Conclusions and policy implications Early postnatal home visit is one strategy for providing critical interventions to improve newborn survival. Given the compelling data in this study, we recommend that in developing countries, especially those where home delivery with unskilled attendants is the norm, all newborns should receive a home visit and undergo assessment by a trained worker as soon as possible, preferably on the day of birth but no later than 48 hours after birth. The impact of this approach is likely to be dependent on the content, quality, and coverage of the technical interventions included. Reaching neonates within first day or first two days of life is a challenge. Given that the community health workers in this study were not skilled birth attendants and attended only about 5% of deliveries, a complementary strategy will be to ensure skilled attendance at delivery that is linked to essential obstetric care.31 32 Further operational research will be needed to develop context specific strategies to reach all newborns as soon as possible after birth.  </text>

      <text>Assessment of various forms of bevavioural addictions A first approach for the comprehensive and standardized assessment of different forms of behavioural addictions (e.g., pathological gambling, workaholism, compulsive buying) is the German self-assessment questionnaire "Fragebogen zur Differenzierten Anamnese exzessiver Verhaltensweisen" (FDAV, Questionnaire on Differentiated Assessment of Excessive Behaviours) [96]. The FDAV is based on the criteria of substance-related addictions, pathological gambling and impulse control disorders of the ICD-10 [3] and the DSM-IV-TR [2]. The FDAV is a modified version of the "Fragebogen zur Differenzierten Drogenanamnese" (FDDA; Questionnaire on Differentiated Assessment of Addiction, QDAA) [97]. Its seven modules obtain "sociodemographic information" (e.g., age, profession, marital status), "history of excessive behaviour" (e.g., diagnostic criteria for addictions and impulse control disorder, individual patterns of behaviour, craving symptoms), "critical life events" (stress caused by traumatic events), "legal situation", "medical history", "physical and psychological complaints", and "emotional state" (triggering psychological conditions, or consequences of the addictive behaviour, respectively). Every module can be administered separately according to the suspected behavioural addiction, thereby making the FDAV an economical tool in assessing behavioural addictions. The FDAV is suitable for diagnostics, evaluation of therapy and follow-up in clinical practice and research. Currently, the FDAV is being validated in clinical and non-clinical samples. </text>

A mean of &gt;98% (range 92-100%) of the PTV1 received 100% of the prescribed dose in all planning methods. A mean of 95.5% and 95.7% of the PTV2 received 100% of the prescribed dose with TOMO and IMRT plans respectively. A mean of 94% and 92% of the PTV2 received 100% of the prescribed dose with IB and 3D treatment plans, respectively. The mean IB and 3D plans PTV2 coverage was significantly inferior then the IMRT and TOMO plans (p &lt; 0.02, for all comparisons). The mean Inhomogeneity Coefficient (IC) was significantly lower (better) with the TOMO plans, compared to all other plans for both PTV1 and PTV2 (p &lt; 0.0003 for all comparisons) (figure 3). The mean IC of the IMRT plans was significantly higher (worse) than the mean IC of the 3D plans regarding PTV 1 (p &lt; 0.02) and higher (worse) then the mean IC of the IB plans regarding PTV2 (p &lt; 0.03) (figure 3). No significant difference was found between the means of the IC of the 3D and IB plans. Figure 3 The mean Inhomogeneity Coefficient (IC) achieved by the different planning methods. The mean of the Inhomogeneity Coefficient is a measure of dose inhomogeneity in the target volumes. The closer the IC to zero, the more homogenous the dose is. </text>

      <text>Surgery Trabeculectomy should be considered in all patients, when the 'target IOP' is not achieved with glaucoma medications and if the expected rate of visual loss could affect the patient during their lifetime. In this procedure, an opening is made in the trabecular meshwork, so that aqueous humor can drain into the sclera. Many patients can discontinue glaucoma medications after surgery. Approximately one-third of the trabeculectomy patients develop cataract within five years. If trabeculectomy fails, another type of surgery places a drainage tube (Molteno tube) in the eye, between the cornea and iris, which exits at the junction of the cornea and sclera. Cyclodestructive procedures, which lower IOP by destroying the ciliary body, are typically reserved for eyes, which are refractory to all other forms of therapy. These procedures include cyclocryotherapy, cylcodiathermy and laser cyclophotocoagulation.[91-93] </text>

      <text>Follow-up Patients were followed up at the outpatient clinic at 1, 4, and 7 months after the ablation procedure and every 6 months thereafter. Routine 24 or 48 h Holter monitoring was performed before each appointment, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram was obtained at each visit. Patients were asked to report to the emergency room or our arrhythmia unit for an ECG if any symptom suggestive of recurrence occurred between scheduled visits. After the ablation procedure, all patients received anti-arrhythmic treatment for at least 1 month to protect against early recurrences and continued oral anticoagulation for a minimum of 2 months to maintain an international normalized ratio between 2.0 and 3.0. Additionally, magnetic resonance angiography was repeated at 3-6 months after the procedure to evaluate the presence of PV stenosis. Arrhythmia recurrence was defined as a documented AF or atrial flutter episode of &gt;30 s. Arrhythmic episodes within the first 3 months after the CPVA (healing period) were not considered in the evaluation of final success rates because they are often described as transient recurrences related to atrial inflammatory processes following RF lesions.26 The endpoint of the study was freedom from arrhythmia recurrence after a single CPVA procedure, without anti-arrhythmic medication. A minimum follow-up of 3 months was required. </text>

      <text>Background Refractive outcomes have become an increasingly important part of cataract surgery and the limbal relaxing incision (LRI) has been shown to be a safe and effective procedure to reduce astigmatism [1-4]. Currently, ophthalmic surgeons have only two material choices for knives to perform limbal relaxing incision, diamond and metal. BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company), Franklin Lakes, NJ has developed a safety engineered, single use, uni-directional cutting silicon knife for these incisions. Previous research has suggested that the silicon BD Atomic Edge(TM) knife has superior performance characteristics when compared to a metal knife and performance similar to diamond knife when making various incisions [5,6]. This study was designed to determine the performance characteristics of silicon accurate depth knives in comparison to diamond LRI knives and steel accurate depth knives in five performance characteristics. </text>

In (A) through (C), only the SNARE core complex is considered. Interaction free energies are calculated for (B) a series of SNARE/membrane distances and (C) different membrane lipid compositions. Arrow in (B) indicates the most physiologically relevant distance when the closest points between SNARE and membranes are 3 A, the thickness of a layer of water.[19] In (D) through (F), TMDs of VAMP and syntaxin are present and embedded in membranes. Furthermore, the C-terminus of the SNARE motif is partially unraveled into individual alpha-helices by molecular dynamics simulations to represent trans-SNARE complex. Interaction free energies are then calculated for (E) a series of SNARE motif C-terminus separation distances and (F) different lipid compositions of the membranes. Conclusions drawn from both groups of studies are essentially the same. V (circles): Interaction energies between the SNARE complex and the v-membrane. T (squares): Interaction energies between SNARE and the t-membrane. VT (triangles): Interaction energies between the v- and the t-membranes if the SNARE complex were extracted. </text>

      <text>1. Background The United Republic of Tanzania, is among the many countries in sub-Saharan Africa facing a human resources crisis in its health sector, with a small and inequitably distributed health workforce [1] that shoulders a disproportionately high burden of disease[2]. Although all poor countries in the world face a severe human resource crisis in their health sectors [3,4], the problem is most acute in Sub-Saharan Africa, in which an estimated workforce of 750 000 health workers in the region serves 682 million people [2]. By comparison, the ratio is 10 to 15 times higher in developed countries. Moreover, this estimated workforce of doctors, nurses and allied health workers in Sub-Saharan Africa constitutes 1.3% of the world's health workforce, while Africa suffers from 25% of the world's burden of disease [2]. A minimum level of a health workforce of 2.5 health workers per 1000 people is required to achieve the Millennium Development Goals [5]. Africa is far from this level with a health workforce density that only averages 0.8 worker per 1000 people, while the world median density of health personnel is 5 per 1000 people [5]. There is a positive correlation between health worker density and various health indices, most notably infant mortality rate, maternal mortality rates, and various disease specific mortality and morbidity rates [6,7]. An increase in the number of health workers per capita is associated with a notable decline in the rates mentioned above. As a consequence, it has been argued that health worker shortages have impeded the implementation of development goals in many poor countries [8].  </text>

      <text>Applying A1C cut offs to the AusDiab population (4.6% undiagnosed diabetes) Applying the same cut offs, a total 75.9% of the AusDiab population had diabetes ruled in or ruled out (Fig. 1B), while the remaining 24.1% had impaired A1C. From those with impaired A1C, 69.3% had abnormal glucose status. For diabetes, A1C at 5.5% provided moderate sensitivity (83.5%) but high NPV (99.0%), since diabetes prevalence was lower in the AusDiab than in the MP population. A1C at 7.0% gave 100% specificity and 100% PPV. By dropping the cut off to 6.5%, specificity remained 99.9%, with PPV near 100%. </text>

      <text>Calcium intake and effects on QUS T-score Figure 5 shows the amounts of dietary calcium intake according to menopausal status. Calcium consumption in most groups, like that in the study population as a whole, was inadequate. Fewer than one third of premenopausal and postmenopausal women received more than 800 mg calcium daily, and fewer than 16% of premenopausal women in the 50-59 age decade (n = 38) consumed more than 800 mg calcium daily. Figure 5 Daily calcium intake in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. This figure depicts the daily amounts of dietary calcium intake (and percent) according to menopausal status using 800 mg daily as cut off point. QUS T-score were then calculated according to daily calcium intake in all premenopausal and postmenopausal activity groups using 800 mg daily calcium as cutoff point. As shown in Tables 3 and 4 and Figure 6, premenopausal women who were systematically active and consumed more than 800 mg calcium daily had significantly higher QUS T-scores compared with all other activity groups (p &lt; 0.05). Among systematically active premenopausal women who received more than 800 mg calcium per day, this difference was separately significant verses sedentary (p = 0.028) and moderately active (p = 0.04) women. In contrast, postmenopausal women showed no difference in QUS T-scores regardless of the amount of daily calcium intake. Figure 6 Synergy between physical activity and dietary calcium intake in women consuming calcium amounts greater than 800 mg/day. This graphic depicts mean QUS T-score values calculated according to daily calcium intake in all premenopausal and postmenopausal activity groups using 800 mg daily as cut off point (for statistical significant values see text). </text>

      <text>Discussion This is the first study to employ such a large number of replicated samples in order to assess the bacterial communities of healthy and diseased corals, and the first culture-independent assessment of bacterial communities on Acroporid WS corals on the GBR. Despite the potential of not capturing rare or very low abundance bacterial ribotypes, the DGGE analysis used in this study indicated similar results of captured bacterial ribotypes and tentative bacterial species replacement in unhealthy corals to that of less replicated studies using other non-culture based techniques (e.g. [3], [54], [69]; Figure 4). The results from this research reinforce, with statistically relevant data, that corals harbour bacterial communities different to the water column [7], [9], [42], corroborate findings that corals associate only with certain specific bacterial groups, and that these coral-associated bacterial communities are 'host' species-specific [2]. The data presented here highlight a cluster of bacterial ribotypes frequently associated with corals, and the distribution of these bacterial ribotypes on healthy and diseased corals, which allows for further targeted research into a tentative link between these common coral associates and coral health. This study indicates that coral bacterial community assessments require a number of replicates per coral species and site to accurately describe the diversity present across the population and in order to draw inferences on health-related changes in the community composition. In addition, the comparisons of healthy and diseased Acropora hyacinthus samples showed that bacterial communities can change dramatically in diseased individuals. The DGGE profiles observed for corals displaying signs of White Syndrome comprised a range of bacterial ribotypes not generally found on healthy corals, including close relatives of bacteria previously found on Black Band Diseased corals. However the community profiles across the samples taken from diseased coral colonies were inconsistent and not indicative of a single bacterial causative agent.  </text>

      <text>The eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma brucei is able to import inositol from the environment or synthesize it de novo. However, according to the current model, inositol imported from the environment is utilized primarily in bulk phosphatidylinositol (red and yellow phospholipid) production via a phosphatidylinositol synthase (PIS) localized to the Golgi complex. Inositol synthesized de novo is primarily used to generate phosphatidylinositol that is used for production of glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs). The de novo-synthesized inositol is believed to be utilized mostly for GPI production because the IMPase that dephosphorylates inositol 3-phosphate to inositol is localized to the ER, where GPI synthesis occurs. Mutants lacking TbINO1 are inviable because of diminished GPI production. </text>

      <text>2. CLINICAL PROTEOMICS AT THE BEDSIDE Clinically-based proteomics has a large potential for the development of strategies which aim to alleviate risk associated with cardiac disease. Biomarkers that are used in clinical practice are highly useful in that they support medical decision making, by complementing other diagnostic tests, such as the medical history, physical examination, and various other special tests. Theoretically, there are three criteria that, if satisfied, would provide an optimal biomarker of the disease state. First, the potential biomarkers must be easily measurable in a short time period at a cost that is practical. Second, elevation of this protein would offer diagnostic information that was not previously present in the absence of the protein. Third, the information obtained would aid in the medical decision making process performed by the clinician [11]. Fulfillment of such criteria encourages follow-up of such a biomarker in other model systems or patient cohort samples. For instance, cardiac troponin I has been previously shown to fulfill such criteria, and further follow-up in patient cohorts is underway. Recently, this approach was utilized to ascertain whether Cardiac Troponin I (CTN I) or Creatine Kinase-Myoglobin (CK-MB) could be used as short-term or long-term markers of risk associated with cardiac surgery [12]. In this study, a patient cohort of 252 individuals who had undergone cardiac surgery was used to analyze levels of these two proteins in blood. Not only was CTN-I shown to be a strong predictor of mortality, but increases in the levels of this protein also correlated well with increases in mortality. Findings from this study support the utilization of patient cohorts as a means to ease the transition from bench to bedside. </text>

      <text>Treatment for patients with diabetes It is notable that treatment of diabetes has not been directly monitored by OECD indicators, largely due to complexity in data collection. Treatment is tailored for individuals depending on the patient's disease status, and plays a crucial role in diabetes management. Clinical trials have found that a one percentage point reduction in HbA1c levels would reduce micro-vascular complications by 25% to 30% [49,50] and a 10 mmHg reduction in blood pressure would decrease macro- and micro-vascular complications and death rates by 32% [51]. Improved control of blood lipids can reduce risk of coronary heart disease by 39% and risk of death by 43% [52]. RAND's Quality Assessment Tools System offers indicators relating to diabetes treatment [53], and application of these indicators in a national study in the US has provided insight into adherence to recommended treatment regimens. For people with newly diagnosed diabetes 56% received dietary and exercise counselling. In type 2 diabetes patients, use of oral hypoglycaemic agents for those inadequately controlled on dietary therapy was 38% and use of insulin for those inadequately controlled on oral hypoglycaemics was 39%. Fifty-five percent of diabetics were offered an ACE inhibitor within 3 months of the notation of proteinuria unless contraindicated. The AusDiab study reported the treatment pattern among Australian adults with type 2 diabetes [37]. While 32% of diabetes patients were on diet regimen only, 58% used oral hypoglycaemic agents and diet only, and another 10% took insulin. Bailie and colleagues reported pharmaceutical interventions for diabetes patients in remote Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory [54]. During the 3-years study period, 75-79% of Aboriginal patients took oral hypoglycaemic agents, and 4-7% used insulin. </text>

      <text>Histological analysis A cross-section of the distal colon (2 cm) was fixed in 10% paraformaldehyde solution. Afterwards, it was cut into small fragments, dehydrated through an ethanol series (70%-100%), cleared in xylol and embedded in paraffin. The fragments were sliced into 5 mum thick sections and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Histological evaluation was done by a pathologist who was blinded to the experimental groups, and it was based on the intensity of mononuclear and polymorphonuclear infiltrates in the lamina propria, crypt dilation, cellular destruction and mucosal ulceration. Histopathological changes were graded according to the degree of inflammation using the following scale: absent (0), light (1), moderate (2) and intense (3), and the numbers represented the inflammation score (IS). Results were expressed as mean values of IS +/- standard error of the mean (SEM) for each experimental group. </text>

      <text>Intervention Patients' initial introduction to the Wrist Extension Dynasplint (WED) system, [Dynasplint Systems, Inc., Severna Park, MD, USA] included customized fitting (wrist length, width, and girth so that the force and counter force straps could be properly aligned) and training on donning and doffing of the device. (See figure 1.) Verbal and written instructions were provided throughout the duration of treatment for safety, general wear and care, and tension setting goals based on patient tolerance. Figure 1 Wrist Extension Dynasplint. Each patient initially wore the WED for 4-6 continuous hours at an initial tension setting of #2 (0.1 foot pounds of torque). This duration was for acclimatization to the system; then patients were instructed to wear the WED system at night while sleeping for 6-8 hours of continuous wear. After each patient was comfortable wearing the unit for one week at tension level #2, they were instructed to increase the tension level to #3 (0.3 ft lbs.) and make continual increases every two weeks. If prolonged soreness followed a session (soreness for more than 15 minutes) the patient was instructed to decrease the tension one half a setting for two days until they were comfortable wearing it for 6-8 hours at the new tension setting. The majority of all patients reached level #5 (0.8 foot pounds of torque) by the end of two months. All range of motion measurements were recorded by the prescribing clinician. </text>

      <text>Study Population This prospective longitudinal study was conducted at the University of British Columbia and was approved by the human research ethics board at that institution. All subjects who received a renal transplant from January 2005 to December 2007 were invited to participate, and those who agreed and signed consent forms were enrolled in the study. Patients were followed routinely at the transplant center, and blood and urine samples were obtained prior to and serially post-transplant at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 26 weeks; then every 6 months through year 3; and also at the time of suspected rejection. Graft biopsy tissue was obtained pretransplant and at the time of all biopsies performed post-transplant. Blood samples from normal healthy controls served as reference samples. Samples from cases, controls, and comparators were treated identically. All rejection episodes were diagnosed by conventional clinical and laboratory parameters, confirmed by biopsy, and graded according to the Banff 97 working classification of renal allograft pathology (28). Banff categories 2 and 4 (antibody-mediated or acute/active cellular rejection) were considered significant. Category 3 (borderline change) was only considered significant if associated with graft dysfunction and treated for rejection. All baseline demographic and follow-up data were recorded in the transplant program electronic database, and there was no loss to follow-up during the period of study. </text>

      <text>Animals STOP null mice and their WT littermates were generated on a mixed BALBc/129 SvPas and on a pure 129 SvPas background as previously reported by Andrieux et al. [4]. All animals used in the study underwent immunohistochemistry for the detection of STOP protein, resulting in no staining in STOP null mice, and genotyping by PCR as described by Andrieux et al. [4]. All mice were kept under standard housing conditions with a 12-hour/12-hour dark-light cycle. The experiments were carried out in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive of 24 November 1986 (86/609/EEC), and the French Department of Agriculture (License Ndegrees 67-95). The protocol was approved by the ethical Animal Research Committee of Louis Pasteur University (CREMEAS #AL/01/19/10/07). In a first experiment, we searched for differences in glomerular ultrastructure and peripheral neurogenesis between WT and STOP null mice: a first group of 24 mice, 3- to 6- month-old, was used for ultrastructural study of the OBs; a second group of 13 animals was used to analyse proliferation and apoptosis in the OE and VNE on paraffin sections in 3-month-old mice. In a second experiment we analysed, in WT and STOP null mice, the effect of OE regeneration on glomeruli structure and ultrastructure and on peripheral neurogenesis at two age times (3 and 10 months). </text>

      <text>Historical Background of PTSD PTSD gained acceptance in the medical and psychiatric community after a number of studies appeared in prominent medical and psychiatric journals describing the psychiatric symptoms of soldiers who had served and fought in the Vietnam War (Fox 1972; Goldsmith and Cretekos 1969). Subsequent publications described the profound psychological and emotional sequelae secondary to being exposed to extremely traumatic events such as fires, explosions, floods, torture, serious motor vehicle accidents (MVAs), violent crimes, and sexual assault (e.g., Horowitz 1976). These publications posited that individuals with PTSD no longer felt in control of their lives, viewed the world as an unpredictable and dangerous place, lived in fear, and reported a loss of trust in a "just world." These studies also reported that individuals with PTSD avoided thoughts or situations that might trigger traumatic memories, complained of feelings of emotional numbness, and exhibited symptoms of blunted affect. The conceptual refinements coupled with the empirical information generated by these studies significantly advanced our understanding of individuals who have been exposed to a traumatic stressor. This led in 1980 to the inclusion of the diagnostic criteria for PTSD in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders III (DSM-III; American Psychiatric Association 1980). At that time, PTSD was defined as a syndrome that developed in response to a "stressor that would evoke significant symptoms of distress in almost everyone" (p. 238). The DSM-III criteria also required that the individual who developed PTSD had to have been directly exposed to a traumatic event. The DSM-IV criteria (APA 1994) significantly broadened the definition of PTSD to include (a) a "personal experience of an event that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury, or other threat to one's physical integrity" (p. 463) or (b) witnessing a comparable traumatic event or even "learning about unexpected or violent death, serious harm, or threat of death or injury experienced by a family member or a close associate" (p. 462). As a consequence of these modifications, the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for PTSD have been criticized for failing to discriminate between symptoms of PTSD and normal stress reactions (e.g., learning about the 9/11 disaster; Wakefield and Spitzer 2002).  </text>

      <text>Discussion Our results indicate beneficial effects of motivational incentives on cognitive performance and alleviating effects on cognitive decline. These beneficial effects were evident in healthy young and older adults and in patients with Parkinson's disease. Young adults showed improved antisaccade preparation when a reward was at stake; older adults and PD patients could utilize reward prospect to improve their impaired antisaccade preparation. Elderly participants and PD patients were not only better prepared by means of commonly used preparatory aids (i.e., more preparation time and advance information on the upcoming response) but also by means of motivational incentives. These beneficial effects of motivational incentives on cognitive action preparation in healthy and pathological aging further support views that question the notion of monotonic deterioration of cognitive function with age (Allen et al., 2001). They indicate that age-related declines can be modulated by emotion-cognition interactions. In line with the predominant view that cognitive control deteriorates in aging and Parkinson's disease, and in line with previous findings on age-related changes in antisaccade control specifically (Eenshuistra et al., 2004; Chan et al., 2005; Amador et al., 2006; Abel and Douglas, 2007), the current results showed decline in antisaccade preparation in PD patients with severe motor symptoms as compared to healthy seniors. Mild-symptom patients and healthy elderly did not differ in antisaccade preparation. Healthy seniors showed declining antisaccade preparation as compared to young adults. Decline was evident on several oculomotor parameters and most pronounced on antisaccade onset latencies. In line with the notion that in general, elderly tend to prefer accuracy over speed, elderly showed no decreased antisaccade accuracy as compared to young adults. As compared to the young group, elderly and PD patients exhibited slightly, but not significantly more premature eye movements. Premature eye movements, however significantly increased in elderly and PD patients but only slightly in the young, when more specific information on the upcoming movement was available in advance. Presumably, this increase in premature eye movements reflects difficulties with the inhibition of externally guided movement and/or the suppression of strongly activated prepotent action plans. On the one hand, the choice for medicated PD patients represents a limitation of the current study as we cannot exclude differential effects of medication on behavior. On the other hand, PD patients generally take medication in their daily routine, such that the results can be generalized to clinical practice. Exploratory analysis within the PD patient group revealed that patients with more severe motoric symptoms (as indexed by their motoric subscore on the UPDRS) displayed more signs of antisaccade decline, such as longer antisaccade latencies and lower accuracy compared to mildly affected patients, who initiated saccades equally fast as healthy adults. This suggests that dopaminergic medication was not sufficient to raise the patient's antisaccadic preparation up to the level of the healthy older adults. One intriguing observation was that despite the different extents of observed antisaccade performance decline in elderly and PD patients, reward prospect led to beneficial effects on antisaccade latency and accuracy in young, elderly, and PD patients alike. Young, elderly and PD patients benefited from reward prospect to the same extent, confirming that the expectancy of reward is a powerful mediator of cognitive control, even if cognitive control suffers from decline. The expectation of rewarding incentives thus seems to support older adults' and PD patients' ability to anticipate, prepare and initiate goal-directed behavior. These findings imply that despite a general decline in the action preparation system as indexed by increased antisaccade latency, action preparation processes remain susceptible to the prospect of future reward. It could thus be argued that the neural representations of upcoming rewards influence neural systems concerned with action preparation and oculomotor control. Although the current behavioral results cannot exclude or confirm neural links between reward anticipation and action preparation systems in the brain, they suggest intact cross-talk among subcortical circuits that allow goal-directed action to be modified by motivational factors. The motivational neural reward anticipation signal presumably activates the reward network including the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, the more ventral and dorsal striatum (nucleus accumbens, putamen, and caudate), leading to an release of caudate/SNr inhibition on the executive oculomotor structure superior colliculus. This transiently decreased inhibitory force on superior colliculus may improve goal-directed oculomotor control. Thus reward anticipation might compensate for the age- and disease-related dopaminergic loss in the SNc projections to the caudate/SNr and may thus play a compensatory role in "boosting" the efficiency of interactions between motivational and impaired cognitive control processes. However the reward-related modulation of the oculomotor control system may not only apply to the basal ganglia part of the oculomotor network. Although speculative, it could extend to the cortical eyefields (frontal, supplementary, and parietal eyefields) and to parts of the visual cortex. Human research shows that more preparatory activation in the frontal eyefields leads to a faster antisaccade latency (Connolly et al., 2002, 2005). The compensatory effect on the antisaccade latency, therefore, could theoretically stem from a propagation of reward anticipation signal in the caudate to the frontal eyefields. Complex structural connections enable the striatum to exert a controlling influence over the cerebral cortex via a series of reentrant corticobasal ganglia circuits. Thus reward anticipation may increase the level of preparation in the intact cortical eyefields and thereby compensate for age- and disease-related subcortical decrements in the oculomotor network. Taken together, it seems plausible that motivational reward processes in the caudate enhance preparatory activation in subcortical as well as in cortical nodes of the oculomotor network. Several neurotransmission mechanisms may underlie the remedial effect of positive incentives on declining antisaccadic control. Given the convergence of dopamine and glutamate inputs at the spiny projection neurons in the striatum (Burns et al., 1994), an interaction between dopamine and glutamate might underlie striatal processes of reward anticipation and action preparation. However, it cannot be fully excluded that alterations in other neurotransmitter systems may also have an effect on declining oculomotor control and on remediating incentive effects. Non-dopaminergic changes such as noradrenergic, serotonergic, and cholinergic deafferentation of the cortex also occur in PD and can inflict cognitive deficits (Agid et al., 1987). Evidence from non-human primates suggests that basal ganglia dopamine acts to speed motor responding in response to rewarding cues (Niv, 2007; Niv et al., 2007). Among at least five types of DA receptors, mainly D1 and D2 receptors are expressed in caudate projection neurons (Nakamura and Hikosaka, 2006). Tendencies to speed responses to obtain large rewards have been found to be dependent on striatal D1 receptors (Dalley et al., 2005; Berridge, 2007). In contrast to this D1 modulated speeding in reward-motor tasks, evidence from saccade tasks in non-human primates suggests D2 receptor modulation of reward dependent improvements of performance (Nakamura and Hikosaka, 2006). Injections of a D1 antagonist and a D2 antagonist into the region of the caudate where saccade-related neurons are clustered while the monkey performed a reward-biased saccade task showed that D1 antagonists attenuate the reward modulation of saccade behavior whereas D2 antagonists into the same region enhanced the reward-dependent changes. Future studies of Parkinson patients on versus off medication, could provide some information on the role of dopaminergic mechanisms in the remedial effects on antisaccadic performance. A recent study of reward learning in Parkinson patients on/off dopaminergic medication showed that patients adapted their behavior to maximize expected reward value dependent on their medication status (Moustafa et al., 2008). Whilst off dopaminergic medication, patients slowed their responses to avoid low expected values, but succeeded less well in speeding responses when a reward was at stake. The opposite pattern emerged when the same patients were on medication; patients showed better response speeding, and worse response slowing, to maximize expected value. The current behavioral findings are in line with neuroimaging research showing intact neural representations of future reward in the aging striatum (Samanez-Larkin et al., 2007). The observation however that older adults and PD patients can use this intact neural representation of reward anticipation (a positive motivational incentive) to optimize their preparatory processes, cannot necessarily be generalized to cognitive contexts with negative motivational incentives. Samanez-Larkin et al.(2010) recently showed that older adults were not able to optimally use their intact neural reward anticipation system in risky financial decision making. Elderly made more suboptimal choices when they were to choose risky assets. The authors deemed it likely that these decrements in value-based decision making are explained by the fact that value-based decision making requires the weighting of behavioral alternatives, that may lead to either gain or loss. During anticipation of rewards older adults show similar neural responses as young adults but they show reduced neural activation during the anticipation of losses (Samanez-Larkin et al., 2007). The latter, together with the observation that older adults tend to shift their attention away from negative stimuli and attend to positive information instead (Mather and Carstensen, 2003, 2005), may have led to the underestimation of loss and therefore to more risky and suboptimal decisions. In this respect, one limitation of the current task is that it built solely on reward prospect and not on the prospect of loss, such that the question of how the anticipation of loss influences action preparation was not tested. The impact of negative incentives might be an intriguing question for future research, as due to the decreased activation of the neural loss anticipation system (Samanez-Larkin et al., 2007) together with the observed differential attentional bias for negative and positive information (Mather and Carstensen, 2003), it seems likely that negative motivational incentives, i.e., the prospect of loss, might have a different impact on action preparation in older adults than in the young. Future approaches to the effect of loss anticipation on declining antisaccade control may ideally contain a sequence of experiments, starting with a separate (punishment only) approach before moving to combined reward-punishment designs. This might be necessary as previous evidence (from healthy young adults) suggests that the reward effect on oculomotor control disappears in the presence of punishment trials. The authors deemed it likely that the participants increased caution to all incentive (reward and punishment) trials (Blaukopf and DiGirolamo, 2006). As of yet, age-related changes in neural reward anticipation have mainly been studied in isolation. Recently however, the interaction of neural reward processing with other cognitive functions and their underlying neural systems, such as the action control system, has gained increasing interest (Haber and Knutson, 2010). Initial evidence suggests coordinated activity between distant brain regions responsible for reward processing (Cohen et al., 2009). The current results encourage further neural network investigations on the role of coordinated brain network activity in motivated behavior. Behavioral benefits from motivation might be associated with changes in functional brain connectivity on a larger scale, e.g., between frontostriatal reward and action preparation structures. Another important factor that emerges from the present and previous results, is the importance of the training of the motivational aspects of the instructions that need to be kept in working memory when performing a cognitive task. Samanez-Larkin et al. (2007) found intact neural reward anticipation processes specifically in the absence of learning (after the learning process of reward cue-reward associations was completed). Therefore it might be important for researchers doing experiments with motivation based instructions to keep in mind that, compared to young adults, elderly and PD patients are generally hampered on stimulus-response learning (Shohamy et al., 2004; Marschner et al., 2005). Reward instruction cues, as they were used in the current study require participants to form reward cue-reward associations. Impairments in the learning of associations between the cue signaling reward and the actual reward might conceal intact reward anticipation processes. When the formation of associations is weakened, it could appear as a failure to capitalize on the neural reward anticipation system, whereas it represents an indirect effect of non-available reward associations in working memory when preparing the response. Hence, one might circumvent the effect of potential learning impairments on reward anticipation processes by the training of abstract reward cues (as in the current and in Samanez-Larkin's study) or by using explicit and concrete rewards. Once the learning of reward cues is accomplished the intact reward anticipation processes might become evident. In sum, the results confirmed that the preparation of goal-directed actions declined in PD patients compared to healthy seniors, and in healthy seniors compared to young adults. Due perhaps to deterioration in dopaminergic striatal circuitry, antisaccade performance is subject to decline in healthy seniors, and even more in individuals with Parkinson's disease. The prospect of future reward however provided a motivational incentive for optimizing oculomotor preparation in all groups alike. These results suggest that reward-processing networks and oculomotor-control networks in the brain are connected in such a way (presumably with the dorsal striatum as a common nexus) that reward anticipation can facilitate oculomotor control and alleviate the deficiencies experienced by healthy seniors and PD patients. Future investigations should examine whether the observed effects are specific for the current task or generalize to other tasks that show age- and PD-related cognitive decrements (e.g., in task switching) and have been related to dopaminergic denervation in the caudate (e.g., impaired verbal episodic memory, attention, and response inhibition; Rinne et al., 2000; Bruck et al., 2005). Future studies on network processes may help to localize the neural link between reward prospect and action preparation that enables alleviating effects of motivational incentives on cognitive decline. </text>

      <text>Different ROC analysis When the true positive peptides are not known a priori, there exist various strategies in classifying hits into true or false positives when making a ROC plot. These strategies, unfortunately, will make a notable difference in retrieval assessment. For example, in a cell lysate experiment of a certain organism, it is customary to estimate the number of false positive hits by introducing a decoy database during the data analysis. The main idea there is to first sort the peptide hits according to their scores. Then for each decoy hit, one assumes that there is just one corresponding false hit in the target database. This strategy has been used extensively [24]. ROC analyses done this way generally count false positives, which are highly homologous to the target peptides, towards true positives. This has two effects: an overcount of true positives and a undercount of false positives. As a consequence, the ROC curves will appear more impressive. To mimick this situation, we used BLAST to find in the NCBI's nr database highly homologous proteins to the target proteins used in the experiment and include those proteins in our true positive set. This strategy produces ROC curves shown as the solid curves of Figure S8. When compared to Figure 6 and Figure S6, the ROC curves produced by this strategy seem much more impressive. Not counting highly homologous proteins as false positives would probably be agreeable. However, counting those peptides/proteins as true positives could be exaggerating. Therefore one may use a slightly different strategy: removing from consideration proteins homologous to the target proteins, which is called the cluster removal strategy [11]. The dashed curves of Figure S9 are ROC curves obtained this way. This strategy also produces slightly more impressive ROC curves than in Figure 6 and Figure S6. Apparently, this indicates the highly homologous false positive hits are the ones that degrade the retrieval performance. Thus, it can be useful to remove those false positives from consideration. Keeping only the best hit per spectrum turns out to be one way to achieve this goal. </text>

      <text>Measurement of IgA1 content IgA1 content in the supernatant from each culture well was measured in duplicate using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All incubations were performed at room temperature except for capture antibody coating. Briefly, 96-well immunoplates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were coated with 5 microg/mL of F(ab')2 fragment goat anti-human IgA antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA), in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4degreesC overnight. After three washes with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST), plates were blocked by adding PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) to the wells for 90 min. Next, 50 microL of supernatant sample or standard human IgA1 (CALBIOCHEM, La Jolla, CA, USA) was added to the reaction wells and then incubated for 90 min. After three washes, 0.75 microg/mL alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti-human IgA (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL, USA) in 1% BSA/PBS was added to the reaction wells and then incubated for 90 min. Plates were washed three times and developed with a substrate solution of 1 mg/mL p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO, USA) in 0.1 M glycine buffer containing 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ZnCl2, pH 10.4. The optical density at 405 nm was determined in a microplate reader (Benchmark PlusTM Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). IgA1 concentration in unknown duplicate samples was determined by interpolation of the respective optical density into the appropriate standard curve. IgG and IgM contents in the supernatant were measured using sandwich ELISA (IMMUNOtek(R), ZeptoMetrix Corporation, Buffalo, NY, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. </text>

      <text>Introduction Adipose tissue, once viewed as simply a storage and release depot for lipids, is now considered an endocrine tissue [1,2] that secretes various substances (adipokines), including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-6, leptin, adiponectin, resistin, visfatin, and omenetin [3,4]. Among these adipokines, much attention has been paid to adiponectin's relationship with insulin sensitivity and glucose and lipid metabolism in the past 10 years. In addition, adiponectin is known to exhibit potent anti-inflammatory [5], atheroprotective [6], and antidiabetic [7] effects. Recent findings suggest that adiponectin may be involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Levels of adiponectin in synovial fluid and sera were elevated in patients with RA [8,9]. Adiponectin also induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, and IL-8 from RA synovial fibroblasts in vitro [10,11]. Thus, it was suggested that adiponectin can also exert significant proinflammatory and matrix-degrading effects. However, the role of adiponectin in the pathogenesis of RA is still controversial because of conflicting reports about its function [10,12-15]. In particular, adiponectin seems to play an anti-inflammatory role because it significantly inhibited IL-1beta-stimulated synovial cell proliferation in collagen-induced arthritic mice, despite increased IL-6 expression [16]. In contrast, high-grade inflammation in RA patients was negatively correlated with circulating adiponectin concentrations [17]. Rather, it was suggested that circulating adiponectin may be involved in cardiovascular disease in RA patients. Although this contradiction was partly explained by the induction of tolerance to inflammatory stimuli by adiponectin [18], the pro- or anti-inflammatory effects of adiponectin on the pathogenesis of RA remain unknown. With regard to adiponectin's proinflammatory effects, we wondered whether adiponectin might stimulate the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and MMPs as well as proinflammatory mediators like IL-1beta and TNF-alpha do. In this study, we investigated the stimulatory effect of adiponectin on the production of IL-6, IL-8, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), VEGF, and MMPs. In addition, the correlation between adiponectin and VEGF or MMPs was investigated by measuring the levels of these three proteins in the joint fluid of patients with RA or osteoarthritis (OA). </text>

      <text>The importance in identifying genes involved in spinal curvature Spinal curvature is a prevalent and costly deformity among humans and teleosts. The estimated annual cost of treating children hospitalized with idiopathic scoliosis (IS) in the United States alone is over $3 billion. This cost estimate does not consider Scheuermann kyphosis, or adults with idiopathic-type spinal curvature who suffer from chronic back pain, contributing to the estimated $849 billion cost of treatment and lost wages associated with musculoskeletal disease [24]. Among teleosts, spinal column deformities reduce total production in the aquaculture industry substantially [12]. In contrast to humans, teleost curve phenotypes are less well characterized; although heritable curves are acknowledged to account for many cases among cultured stocks, whether these cases are from congenital defects or are idiopathic-type is often not known. Despite the prevalence and impact of this type of deformity, the genetic architecture and specific genes involved are unknown. The current view is that human idiopathic-type scoliosis is a complex genetic disorder with multiple genes segregating in the population exhibiting complex genotype by environment interactions [25-30]. In aquaculture stocks, inheritance for spinal curvature has been described as Mendelian recessive or dominant, as well as polygenic, depending on how well the phenotype is characterized and what stock is considered (reviewed in [13], [16]). The guppy curveback phenotype has been extensively characterized so that the lineage can be applied as a model for understanding the biological context of heritable spinal curvature [1,7-9]. Future studies can use approaches to map QTL affecting shape based on digital photos [31,32], rather than the qualitative scale used in the present study. The identification of QTL in this study is a first step in understanding the genetics of this type of deformity and will lead to the identification of biological pathways associated with spinal integrity. </text>

      <text>Parkin regulates the proteasomal degradation of PARIS and PGC-1alpha-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis. (A) Normal physiological conditions that maintain mitochondrial homeostasis: PINK1 recruits parkin to the mitochondria, where these two proteins interact to eliminate abnormal mitochondria through mitophagy. Alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim; a key indicator of mitochondrial physiology and cell viability) initiate the PINK1-parkin cascade of events that lead to mitophagy. Furthermore, parkin ubiquitylates and thereby promotes proteasomal degradation of PARIS. Because PARIS represses the expression of PGC-1alpha, degradation of PARIS by parkin allows PGC-1alpha-dependent gene expression and enables mitochondrial biogenesis. Parkin seems to be an integral regulator of mitochondrial homeostasis, controlling both degradation and biogenesis. (B) Loss of parkin function as a result of familial mutations (in the case of AR-PD) or aging, environmental or cellular stress (in the case of sporadic PD) leads to the accumulation of abnormal mitochondria, owing to faulty mitophagy. In addition, PARIS accumulates and represses PGC-1alpha, preventing mitochondrial biogenesis. Loss of parkin function does not tip the balance between mitochondrial biogenesis and degradation to either side, but leads to a general breakdown of mitochondrial homeostasis that can ultimately lead to PD. </text>

      <text>Scheme of the activity of 5-HT (A) and norepinephrine (NE) (B) neurotransmission during treatment with milnacipran. A) 5-HT system. Acute treatment with milnacipran results in a decreased firing of 5-HT neurons from the raphe nucleus possibly due in part to increased stimulation of somatodendritic autoreceptors. Long-term treatment with milnacipran results in a full recovery in the firing rate of 5-HT neurons in the presence of milnacipran thereby leading to a net increase in 5-HT neurotransmission. Contributing to this enhancement are: 1) the normalized firing rate of 5-HT neurons in the presence of milnacipran 2) the desensitization of the terminal 5-HT1B autoreceptor, and 3) the desensitization of the alpha2-adrenergic heteroreceptors on 5-HT terminals. B) NE system. Acute treatment with milnacipran results in increased synaptic concentrations of NE but decreased firing of the NE neurons of the locus coeruleus due to increased stimulation of the somatodendritic alpha2-adrenergic autoreceptors. Long-term treatment with milnacipran results in a further increase in synaptic concentrations of NE due to desensitization of presynaptic autoreceptors. The somatodendritic alpha2-adrenergic autoreceptors do not desensitize. </text>

      <text>3.1. Glucose Tolerance Test at Various Times following Dosing DIO mice were treated with a single IV dose of CNTO 530 (0.3 mg/kg), and glucose metabolism was monitored using an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) at various times following dosing (day 1 to 35). CNTO 530 did not influence glucose tolerance 24 hours after dosing. However, a significant improvement was observed in both fasting glucose (179 +/- 29 versus 133 +/- 19 mg/dL for untreated versus treated) and overall glucose tolerance seven days after a single dose of CNTO 530 (Figure 2(b)). In a separate study, the activity of CNTO 530 was compared to a control protein that lacked the EMP-1 peptides to ensure that the observed effects were due to the peptide and not the Fc. The glucose lowering effect was not observed in the mice treated with the protein lacking the EMP-1 peptides (data not shown). Fasting blood glucose remained improved in the treated animals 14 and 21 days after CNTO530 treatment, but was similar to the untreated group after 35 days (data not shown). The area under the curve (AUC) for the glucose tolerance tests showed a significant improvement with CNTO 530 treatment on days 7, 14, 20, and 28 (Figure 2(b)). The most dramatic effect on glucose tolerance following CNTO 530-treatment was observed on day 14 where glucose was cleared from circulation by the 15-minute time point (Figure 2(a)). CNTO 530-mediated acceleration of glucose utilization was diminished but still significant by day 28 and not seen by day 35 (Figure 2(b)). Hemoglobin levels followed a similar time-dependent change, showing an increase that peaked on day 22 and returned to normal levels by day 29 (Figure 2(c)). Similar studies were completed in lean littermate mice fed a normal chow diet. Mice (n = 7) were given a single administration of CNTO 530 (0.01-0.3 mg/kg), and glucose tolerance tests were completed after 1 and 14 days. As we observed in the diabetic rodents, no significant changes were seen in glucose clearance 24 hours after dosing. However, there were significant improvements in the area under the curve in the glucose tolerance test in animals dosed with 0.3 and 0.1 mg/kg CNTO 530 as compared to PBS (22865.4 +/- 1900.2, 24478.9 +/- 1093.4, and 28773.2 +/- 1368.3, resp., mean +/- SEM). There were no dose-dependent changes in the fasting blood glucose. </text>

      <text>4.2. Histological Findings Microscopy revealed features of a diffusely growing discohesive carcinoma, exclusively growing in the alveolar interstitium, thus expanding it, while leaving the original alveolar architecture intact (Figure 2). There was local ulceration of the pleura, while, beyond this ulcer, the tumor formed a thick cake of discohesive tumor cells lining the pleural membrane (Figure 2(c)), with only focal, microscopic invasion into the fatty tissue of the parietal pleura. The tumor consisted of atypical, moderately polymorphous, and irregularly shaped tumor cells with marked discohesiveness. They featured scant eosinophilic cytoplasm and irregularly contoured and hyperchromatic nuclei, often containing one or more prominent nucleoli (Figure 2(b)). There were many mitoses and apoptoses present, but necrosis was not observed. No squamous or glandular differentiation was observed, and mucin stains (PAS-D and alcian blue) were negative. Within the tumor, there were multiple small blood-filled clefts and blood lakes. Angioinvasion in medium-sized vessels, including an artery, was demonstrated (Figure 2(d)). Of note, the broadened alveolar septa were lined by markedly atypical epithelial cells, yet less atypical than the interstitial carcinoma (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). The atypia of the lining cells extended beyond the tumor front, showing a sharp demarcation with normal type I pneumocytes (Figure 2(a)), a feature characteristic to nonmucinous adenocarcinoma in situ with lepidic growth pattern (former bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, BAC) [3]. </text>

      <text>Introduction During the weaning period and transition to solid foods in the first year of life, infants take a critical step in their eating behavior and need to meet high nutrient requirements [1, 2]. They are exposed to new foods and food combinations, which should ensure a smooth transition to the family diet later in life. At this stage, either homemade or commercially prepared foods may be fed. It is worth noting that in prosperous countries the modern diet differs considerably from that of previous generations, now dominated by products that have been processed, stored, and transported over great distances. Traditional, cold-pressed vegetable oils of the highest nutritional quality, e.g. extra virgin olive oil, may therefore constitute an important part of the modern diet [3, 4]. In Poland, many infants do not receive any traditional homemade foods and even fruits come from purchased jars. Commercial baby foods are regarded by some parents and medical professionals to be more appropriate for several reasons: they undergo intense screening for contaminants in comparison to foods sold for the general population, contain no additives of certain types, and are thought to be designed to help infants meet nutrient requirements [5]. The process of peeling, however, was identified as the most effective, and simple, procedure in reducing residues, e.g. pesticides, in fruits and vegetables [6]. Moreover, contrary to homemade food, which does not contain furan, the highest average content of this chemical was found in ready-to-eat baby foods with pasta meals, followed by vegetable meals and meals with meat [7]. Furan is considered to be potentially hazardous chemical and is classified as a possible carcinogen. The problem of this chemical in homemade food may only arise if meals with potatoes are stored and then hardly re-heated [7]. There is a growing body of evidence that flavor experiences and dietary patterns in childhood influence these patterns later in life [1, 8, 9]. It is most likely early in life that culture-specific flavor preferences are initiated [10, 11]. Consequently, exposure to flavors and smells of transitory foods may serve to heighten preferences for "known tastes" in the family diet later in adulthood. Moreover, adopting elements of childhood dinner patterns was recognized to be an important part of the social reproduction of family identities across generations [12]. Processing industries have been successful in manufacturing and marketing jarred baby foods on a commercial scale. Available products contain different ingredients and depend on the manufacturer, country, traditional cuisine, income rate, and lastly, personal beliefs and values of parents [9, 11]. Jarred foods with vegetables, meats, and desserts may contain added fat from a variety of sources: vegetable oils, cow milk butter, or cream. Manufacturer advertising makes the majority of consumers feel safe, causing them to believe that they are doing the best possible in buying given products [11]. A noteworthy fact is that many types of baby foods produced by international manufacturers are, in essence, the same mixtures with different names; this procedure aims to exploit the specifics of local markets without delivering any new, real value [11]. In the book, How to Eat Well and Stay Well the Mediterranean Way by Keys [13] first used the term "good Mediterranean diet" to describe the eating patterns of populations dwelling in southern Europe, where the olive tree (Olea europaea) is an emblematic species [4, 14]. There is variation between the exact diet in different parts of the Mediterranean region. However, generalized and distinctive dietary patterns do exist, including olive oil as the main source of visible fat, employed both in cooking and as a dressing, moderate fish and poultry but low red meat consumption, high intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, and whole-grain cereals [4, 14-16]. When dietary fats are added, in accordance with the traditional Mediterranean diet, olive oil is the choice for children [17]. It has been repeatedly observed that individuals applying the Mediterranean diet have reduced risks of type 2 diabetes and other diseases associated with the metabolic syndrome, autoimmunological diseases, and certain forms of cancer [18]. Moreover, considerable evidence exists that the Mediterranean diet increases quality of life in the course of ageing, as well as longevity [13, 19]. The health benefits of olive oil have been attributed to two main constituents: a high oleic acid (monounsaturated fatty acid, 18:1n-9) content (70-85%) and a large amount of antioxidant compounds, which also possess antiviral, antibacterial, and immunomodulating effects [3, 4, 14, 16]. Polyphenols found in virgin olive oil are linked to both its flavor and its remarkable stability [3]. The introduction of solid foods in infancy is one of the primary matters often discussed by parents with their child's pediatrician. However, many parents do not feel that the diet of their child may be linked to poor health outcomes in the future. Parents should be educated about the interplay of environmental and genetic influences on children, specifically during the early years of development when the child is maturing and taking control of its own diet [11]. Nutrition educators should increase the critical awareness of parents in relation to their child's solid food choices. It is important to emphasize to parents the fundamental role that the Mediterranean diet and consumption of foods with olive oil play in a healthy life style [14, 20]. Parental management of the family food environment may be complicated by numerous mitigating factors, e.g. health literacy, time availability, and financial resources. Considering the role baby food manufacturers play in the infant's contextual environment, their products, as well as the manufacturers themselves, should also be viewed as key players and central agents in establishing dietary habits. Consequently, we attempted to survey manufacturer claims concerning added fat in jarred infant foods supplied to the Polish market. </text>

      <text>2.1.3 Pixel Classification The feature vector of a grid, which consists of nine features, is normalized to [0, 1], and the position features are scaled by the weighting coefficient wpos. Then, taking the nine dimensional vector of each grid as the input of the classifier, the ROI and non-ROI background in ultrasonic breast tumor images can be distinguished. In this section, the self-organizing feature map neural network (SOMNN) [25], proposed by Kohonen according to characteristics of the nervous system, is used for the classification of these grids to detect the ROI automatically. The SOM is trained by the unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional discretized representation of the input space of the training samples, and it uses a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space, which makes it different from other artificial neural networks. In this way, the SOM is able to classify the sub-blocks into n clusters only by the unsupervised learning. In our study, the output layer number n is set to 2 (ROI and non-ROI output) and the feature vector extracted from each grid is taken as the input. To map the sorted sub-blocks back to the size of the original ultrasonic images, the initial result of ROI detection can be represented by a binary image as shown in Fig. (2d), where white areas indicate the ROI candidates while black areas the non-ROIs. </text>

      <text>Patients and Study Design A prospective evaluation of the different CMR parameters for predicting LV segmental and global functional recovery was performed in 46 patients (63 +/- 10 years old, 3 with previous CABG, 35 with three-vessel disease, 3 with one-vessel disease) with LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF 35 +/- 8%) before they underwent surgical (n = 34) or percutaneous (n = 12) revascularisation. Sixty patients without contraindications for CMR were screened for the following inclusion criteria: (1) CAD (&gt; 70% stenosis in one or more major epicardial vessels), scheduled for a revascularisation procedure; (2) LVEF &lt;= 45%; (3) at least two adjacent segments with wall motion abnormalities at rest; and (4) no infarction or revascularisation within the last two months. Patients were included in the study only after a successful and complete coronary revascularisation. Of the 14 patients who did not complete the study, 3 decided not to undergo the repeated CMR scan or were lost during follow-up; 7 had significant periprocedural injury (new LGE zones on repeated CMR scans and clinically proven periprocedural myocardial infarction (MI) or MI between both scans); 3 had pacemakers or defibrillators implanted in the period between the MR scans; and 1 was excluded because of dilated cardiomyopathy with secondary CAD. None of the patients were excluded from the study for technical reasons or image quality. The mean interval between CMR and revascularisation was 12 +/- 13 days, and none of the patients presented clinical evidence of infarction during this period. The mean interval between MI and the first CMR was 3.6 years. In 46 patients, the extent of regional contractility and LGE were determined repeatedly by CMR 28 +/- 4 weeks (6 months) after revascularisation. The study was approved by the Lithuanian Bioethics Committee (Nr. 17), and informed written consent was obtained from each patient prior to inclusion in the study. </text>

      <text>4. The kinetochore The arguments built in the previous section lead to the conclusion that it is essential to understand error correction and spindle checkpoint signalling in the context of the complex structural organization of the kinetochore. A complete account of kinetochore organization is beyond the scope of this review and several reviews on this topic have been made available recently [21,22]. Suffice to say that kinetochores are thought to consist of an inner plate hosting an interface between the 15-subunit constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) and specialized centromeric chromatin; and an outer plate containing the 10-subunit KMN network (from the initials of its Knl1, Mis12 and Ndc80 subcomplexes) implicated in microtubule binding. The CCAN and KMN networks are tightly connected. An interaction between CENP-C (CCAN) and the Mis12 complex (KMN network) provides an important point of contact [81-83]. The existence of additional points of contact, including one between CENP-T (CCAN) and the Ndc80 subcomplex (KMN network) [83,84], is supported by extensive analyses of localization dependencies of kinetochore proteins and from initial experiments of biochemical reconstitution. Biochemical and structural studies, including super-resolution investigations of kinetochore organization by fluorescence microscopy, have finally resulted in rather precise maps of the relative position of many structural kinetochore proteins and of several checkpoint components [85-88]. For instance, these studies clarified that the highly elongated 4-subunit Ndc80 complex, conserved in all eukaryotes, orients its approximately 60 nm long axis at a relatively small angle with the inter-kinetochore axis [85-87]. The kinetochore-binding end of the Ndc80 complex was predicted to be positioned near the Mis12 and Knl1 complexes [87,88], and this prediction was fully confirmed in experiments of biochemical reconstitution [89]. In prophase Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells, the C-terminal region of the Ndc80 subunit is located approximately 65 nm outward (i.e. towards the microtubule) relative to CENP-A, the histone H3 variant that marks centromeres from yeast to humans [40]. Remarkably, it was shown that this distance increases to approximately 100 nm when kinetochores experience microtubule-dependent tension at metaphase [40]. This phenomenon is now known as intra-kinetochore stretch or tension [40,90]. A major task for the future is to understand how intra-kinetochore stretch is generated when microtubules bind the kinetochore. At one extreme, intra-kinetochore stretching might be the result of a discreet conformational change in the kinetochore caused by microtubule binding [22,91]. While this is possible, it seems unlikely when considering the great structural complexity of kinetochores. Each microtubule-binding site contains six to eight copies of the approximately 30 structural kinetochore components [85]. Furthermore, in most species, kinetochores are designed to bind multiple microtubules. Plausibly, each microtubule-binding site becomes engaged at a different time. Thus, it may be more sensible to interpret intra-kinetochore stretching as a progressive, continuous distortion of the kinetochore when microtubules are added. In agreement with this idea, intermediate levels of stretching are observed when microtubule end dynamics are inhibited through addition of taxol [40]. Importantly, intra-kinetochore stretch was shown to correlate with the status of checkpoint activation, with high stretch being correlated with checkpoint satisfaction. This idea of checkpoint control is alternative to a previous idea that tension might be monitored at the centromere, i.e. between sister kinetochores (inter-kinetochore tension) [46]. A significant theoretical limitation of the idea that the checkpoint sensor monitors tension between sister kinetochores is that it is not applicable to meiosis I, when the sisters co-orient and the homologues pair through the chiasmata. Conversely, the intra-kinetochore tension idea is also applicable to checkpoint control in meiosis I. </text>

      <text>Discussion In our previous work, we considered in CD families the risk to develop the disease according to a specific HLA haplotypes, obtaining a risk range from 0.01 to &gt;=0.20 [1]. In the present study we evaluated the role of 3 non-HLA genetic markers to influence the CD risk in first relatives of CD affected children. We collected data on families with at least one CD-affected among offspring. This family set helped to evaluate the association between SNPs and CD (TDT on parents-offspring trios) and to estimate the risk of CD in the other sibs. The TDT design provides robustness to population stratification and mitigation of the possible confounding effect of environmental factors, because all family members share the same environment [16]. Ten SNPs, selected from those previously found to be associated with CD by GWAS [13], were successfully genotyped. In our population three SNPs resulted significantly associated with CD (those in LPP, RGS1 and REL genes) and the other seven investigated SNPs, even if not statistically associated with CD, showed always an higher frequency of the previously reported risk alleles [13] in affected subjects than in controls. The three genes selected appear to be appealing for the pathogenesis of CD. LPP (OR = 2.36; p&lt;0.001) was reported to be highly expressed in small intestinal mucosa and may have a structural role at sites of cell adhesion in maintaining cell shape and motility [7]. RGS1 (OR = 1.75; p = 0.025) belongs to a family of RGS genes. It attenuates the signaling activity of G-proteins, blocking the homing of Intra Epithelial Lymphocytes (IELs), and it is specifically expressed both in human small intestinal mucosa and in murine IELs, key players in the development of human CD villous atrophy [7], [17]. REL (OR = 1.66; p = 0.034) is a subunit of NF-kB complex, implicated in T cell differentiation [18] and it appears to be a key molecule regulating inflammation and the switch from tolerance to autoimmunity [19]. It is interesting to note that our data confirm previous pathogenetic implications reported in literature of these SNPs with CD as well as with other autoimmune diseases [20]. By the Bayesian approach we calculated a ranking score (BS) among the sibs. However, it should be considered that BS is not a plain disease risk, rather a method to rank different genotypes according to their contribution to make an individual susceptible to CD. For instance, some of our BS are very near to 1, nevertheless none of the considered genotypes could give a 100% risk to develop the disease. In other terms, we considered the BS as a ranking measure, only stating that a given genotype could assign a higher risk than another genotype but does not allow a quantitative measure of the risk difference (2-fold, 3-fold, etc). However, even if the addition of only 3 SNPs to HLA could be considered at "minor effect" [13], we demonstrated that they could significantly improve the prediction of CD risk in sibs, in terms of diagnostic sensitivity and negative predictive value. So, in a cohort of CD families, our data confirm that non-HLA SNPs evaluation is an usefull diagnostic tool in CD risk evaluation as a previous study showed in CD unrelated subjects [14]. CD, on the basis of the actual knowledge, cannot be exactly predicted by genetic testing, but a reliable probabilistic method might be associated to careful surveillance of infants carrying the higher risk. This will help to significantly reduce the heavy load of anxiety and pain associated with the appearance of symptoms of CD, by anticipating, with simple serological tests, the clinical appearance of the disease. To improve the possibility to identify high risk patients in CD families we propose in alternative to the classical HLA classification (Fig. 4, panel A) a slight improved flow-chart (Fig. 4, panel B): 1) HLA genotyping: subjects belonging to the HLA risk groups 1 and 2 will be classified as at high CD risk; 2) subjects belonging to the HLA risk groups 3 and 4, will be further investigated for our SNPs combination (LPP, REL, RGS1) in order to calculate their BS (Fig. 4, panel B). Among these latter subjects those with a BS &gt;= the median value will be classified at high risk; 3) subjects belonging to the HLA risk group 5 will be considered at low CD risk. All CD familials belonging to the above high risk groups (HLA group 1-2 and HLA group 3-4 with BS &gt;= median) will be undergo a strict surveillance. 10.1371/journal.pone.0026920.g004 Figure 4 Classification flow-chart. In panel A the classical HLA-based classification. In panel B the proposed BS-based classification considering the genotypes of HLA plus LPP, RGS1 and REL SNPs. One of the limitation of our cohort family study could be the sample size, which may have not allowed to explore genes at smaller effect, so explaining the lack of association between SNPs in TAGAP, IL2/IL21, OLIG3, CCR, SH2B3, IL12A and IL12A/SCHIP1 genes with CD although the trend observed in previous studies in unrelated CD patients was confirmed [13]. In the main time the homogeneity of the genetic and environmental domains in the tested families allows to explore risk factors within a controlled cohort. A second limit of the study is the relatively short (6 years) follow up of the sibship, which could cause an underestimation of the disease development at later ages. Our aim is to go on with the monitoring of these families in the next years. In conclusion, the estimate of the CD risk by HLA+SNPs approach, even if not applicable to prevention, could be a precious tool improving CD diagnosis respect to the only HLA (NPV: 95% vs 91%, and DS: 79% vs 45%), in the cohort of first degree relatives. In fact in clinical practice the absence of HLA risk groups 1 or 2, allows to exclude the disease with high probability, while testing the three SNPs in HLA groups 3 or 4 could represent a further tool to identify less frequent CD cases. So, an infant with high HLA+SNPs score even if belonging to HLA low risk groups, shall undergo a simple surveillance system to allow proper diagnosis and treatment before the full blow disease appears. </text>

      <text>Background Eucalyptus globulus is the most widely planted species for pulpwood production in temperate regions of the world and there are breeding programs in numerous countries. There is interest in molecular approaches to breeding, particularly marker assisted selection of wood properties. QTL analysis has an important role in identifying positional candidate genes responsible for variation in wood properties. This is one approach to targeting genes which may harbour functional allelic variants (SNPs). The objective of this study was to detect and validate QTL across multiple sites and pedigrees, in order to identify genomic regions and genes affecting growth and wood properties with wide applicability in the species. We also aimed to determine the proportion of QTL which were stable in their expression across sites of contrasting productivity. Such information will be important to exploit the full potential of the impending Eucalyptus genome sequences. </text>

      <text>Cation binding to yolk platelet phosvitin In addition to non-heme iron [23], yolk phosvitin also contains Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and K+ [11]. Partially relaxed 23Na Fourier transform NMR spectra revealed the existence of at least two major intracellular compartments of NMR-visible Na+ [35]. A large fraction of the Rana oocyte Na+ was NMR-invisible and could be recovered in the yolk platelets [35]. During the first meiotic division there is a net increase in NMR-visible Na+; by completion of the second meiotic division (following fertilization), about 70% of the total Na+ becomes NMR-visible. Thus, phosvitin not only serves as a site for energy storage, but also as a storage site for iron and other ions essential for embryonic development in ponds and streams that contain little dissolved salts and minerals. </text>

      <text>Predicted methylation level of C. gigas genes categorized by biological processes compared to measured level of DNA methylation. Mean CpG O/E for 10,699 C. gigas genes categorized according to Biological Process Gene Ontology (GO) Slim terms are plotted on the x-axis (modified from Gavery and Roberts, 2010). DNA methylation was empirically measured by performing MBD-seq on the SOLiD 4 platform (Applied Biosystems). Genes identified in the MBD-library were associated with respective GO terms and enrichment analysis was performed based on the entire transcriptome (Fleury et al., 2009) using DAVID (Huang et al., 2009a,b). Results indicate the most underrepresented genes in the library are involved in cell adhesion and genes involved in DNA and protein metabolism were most prevalent in the MBD-library. </text>

      <text>Mitochondria in Cardiac Myocyte Apoptosis It has been suggested that activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway leading to executioner casp activation is relevant in heart injury.1 The notion of participation of casp activation in adult cardiac myocyte apoptosis emerged from studies using immunofluorescence microscopy16 and casp inhibitors.37 Bahi et al.38 demonstrated that cardiomyocyte levels of all casps decrease with age, and they are very low in adult cardiac cells. Recently, Bae et al.39 reported that apoptosis can be induced in the heart lacking casp activation via casp-independent pathways, probably through apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways can be inhibited by the cytoprotective protein apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC). ARC inhibits the extrinsic pathway by interacting with casp 8 and components of the death-inducing signaling complex, such as FADD, whereas inhibition of the intrinsic pathway is mediated by blocking BAX activation and mitochondria translocation.40 AIF is anchored by its N terminus to the mitochondrial inner membrane, with its C terminus oriented toward the intermembrane space. AIF is required for oxidative phosphorylation and for the assembly and/or stabilization of respiratory complex I.41 Upon induction of apoptosis, AIF is cleaved and released into the cytosol, where it translocates to the nucleus and mediates chromatin condensation and large-scale DNA fragmentation.41 However, this well-known pro-apoptotic action of AIF is in conflict with the observation that AIF is essential for the maintenance of normal heart function and its inactivation results in dilated C.42 Moreover, cardiac myocytes isolated from a mouse model with 80% reduction in AIF levels manifested increased cell death induced by oxidative stress, and the hearts of these mice displayed enhanced ischemic damage after in vivo I/R.43 Although it has been described that AIF is released from cardiac myocyte mitochondria during I/R, its contribution to I/R-induced apoptosis was discounted.38 However, AIF has been implicated in cardiac myocyte death induced by oxidative stress and HF.44 Endonuclease G (Endo G) is a nuclear-encoded endonuclease localized to the intermembrane space of mitochondria. In cardiac myocyte apoptosis, Endo G translocates to the nucleus, where it cleaves DNA. In heart and cultured cardiac myocytes, Endo G has a role in I/R-mediated cell death.38 Activation of the intrinsic pathway by the extrinsic apoptotic pathway can take place through casp-8-dependent cleavage of BCL2-interacting protein (BID) to truncated BID (t-BID). The C-terminal fragment of t-BID subsequently translocates to the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it presumably activates the intrinsic pathway. This pathway is operative in the heart.1 </text>

      <text>Discussion We estimated the future acceptability of PrEP, examining the attitudes and preferences of potential user groups from different countries towards hypothetical and known PrEP attributes. Our results show that participants were generally willing to accept PrEP and adopt it as soon as it becomes available. Surprisingly, participants were also willing to take PrEP even when reminded of potential side effects, cost, condom use, and frequent HIV testing. These findings indicate participants' motivation to overcome barriers which can have a considerable impact on uptake. In contrast, participants mentioned that the thought of taking PrEP made them feel anxious, although they also indicated that taking PrEP would not be embarrassing and they would want their partner or partners to know. Participants' anxiety may be explained by the hypothetical nature of most of the presented PrEP characteristics, the stigma associated with HIV [34], and in some settings, the criminalization of sex work, injected drug use and homosexuality [35]. Most participants, nonetheless, subsequently indicated that PrEP would give them hope, which suggests that their initial willingness to take it remained largely unscathed. Female participants indicated a higher level of willingness to take PrEP than male participants, which may be explained by women's difficulty negotiating the use of condoms and awareness of their and/or their partners' risk of becoming infected with HIV [36]. We also found that younger participants and those with fewer children, those who reported adherence to past medication, more frequent condom usage, having been tested for HIV in the past and never injecting drugs, reported greater willingness to take PrEP. These promising findings suggest that those who are currently bearing the brunt of HIV [1], have higher perceived risk, and are most likely to adhere to a comprehensive PrEP program, are also the most motivated to enroll. Yet, while participants stated not being interested in selling PrEP, the majority reported intentions to share it. Therefore, information and counseling about the risks of sharing PrEP should be readily available as part of any implementation program. Results from the conjoint analysis reveal trends in participants' preferences which deserve consideration. PrEP route of administration was the most important attribute, and bi-monthly and monthly injections were the preferred alternatives. This finding is encouraging from a policy perspective if such modalities become available; since it may reduce users' likelihood of sharing, selling or forgetting to take PrEP, but it also raises questions regarding participants' willingness to take oral PrEP. HIV testing was the second most important attribute, and a test every six months was, as expected, the preferred alternative. Interestingly, dispensing sites were more important than any other attribute for some groups, particularly in Africa. This may indicate concerns about social stigma and access [37]. However, it is encouraging that most participants were willing to receive PrEP at a healthcare facility, which can facilitate synergies between PrEP and other existing prevention services. Time spent obtaining PrEP and frequency of pick up, which we used as a proxy measure for cost-opportunity, were generally less important, consistent with participants' willingness to pay for PrEP. Our findings are broadly consistent with the work of Guest et al. and Galea et al [18], [19]. However, specific comparisons are not advisable as the composition and size of the samples, recruitment methods, measures and statistical analyses differ greatly. Previous work on PrEP implementation suggests that delivery programs will need to meet a number of requirements in order to be effective, including: prioritization of groups at higher risk of infection; delivery of PrEP in combination with other prevention services, including risk reduction and medication adherence counseling, condoms provision, diagnosis and treatment of other sexually transmitted infections, and frequent HIV testing; and monitoring of side effects, adherence and risk behaviors [8], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42]. Our results provide valuable clues that can help countries to deliver PrEP more effectively, should they decide to implement it, by focusing their efforts on the aspects that need more attention. This is the first multinational study, to our knowledge, that integrates different disciplines to shed light on a question that we believe is of global importance. Our study complements previous work on PrEP by examining potential users' perspective and offering insights into their attitudes and preferences. We note that it may not be possible to generalize the observed PrEP acceptability to other settings and our results should be considered within the context of this study's limitations. Given the sensitive nature of the addressed questions, and despite all our efforts to reduce social desirability bias, there is an unavoidable risk that participants may have felt at times compelled to provide what they felt was the "right" answer. Additionally, our data collection took place in urban areas, where HIV incidence is normally higher, thus current findings may not be generalizable to rural settings. Finally, examining acceptability among users enrolled in pilot programs is much deserving, as actual acceptability may differ from potential willingness to take PrEP, especially if relevant attributes of a product or program are modified, as observed in other comparable interventions [43].  </text>

      <text>Origins of Acquired Antibiotic Resistance Mechanisms Recently, D'Costa et al. (2011) have reported a metagenomic analysis of the Beringian permafrost, which is 30,000 years old. They showed molecular evidences of the ancient origins of antibiotic resistances, detecting beta-lactamases genes, vanX-like, component of the vancomycin resistance operon, and tetM, coding for a protein protecting the ribosomal target from tetracycline. Sequence analysis revealed that the beta-lactamases genes recovered from the permafrost demonstrated an amino-acid homology (53-84%) to known beta-lactamases from beta-lactams producing Streptomyces. The tetM sequences revealed a high similarity to the genes coding for the ribosomal protection protein of actinomycetes. The vanX sequence showed a similarity to the vanX gene recovered in pathogenic vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) and to the vanX gene from Amycolatopsis orientalis. This environmental species, belonging to the actinobacteria phylum, is a natural producer of vancomycin, and very likely the progenitor of the van genes operons, responsible for resistance to vancomycin. The integration of the van operons on transposons and on conjugative plasmids has enhanced their spread (Courvalin, 2006). Reports of VRE in freshwater have been provided by several authors (Talebi et al., 2008; Lata et al., 2009; Luczkiewicz et al., 2010). Interestingly, Schwartz et al. (2003) detected vanA genes in the biofilm of drinking water supplies, in the absence of enterococci, demonstrating the lateral transfer of this gene. Notably, the progenitors of these resistance genes are soil bacteria thus most likely, a shuttle has been responsible for the introduction of these genes into the commensal bacterial community and afterward into the pathogenic species.  </text>

      <text>The TGF-beta type II receptor in chronic myeloid leukemia: analysis of microsatellite regions and gene expression.  Genomic instability is one mechanism proposed to play a role in the disease progression of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Microsatellite regions in the type II transforming growth factor-beta receptor (TGF-beta RII) gene appear to be targets for mutation in some cancers displaying microsatellite instability (replication error phenotype, RER+). Furthermore, TGF-beta RII mutations in RER+ tumors have been associated with decreased TGF-beta RII mRNA levels. As TGF-beta is a potent negative growth regulator of hematopoietic cells, investigations were undertaken to determine whether inactivation of the receptor by microsatellite alteration might be involved in the progression of CML. Analysis of TGF-beta RII mRNA expression by RNase protection, with comparison of cells from the chronic, accelerated and blast phases of CML, showed no change in TGF-beta RII transcript levels during disease progression. However, during each phase of the disease, low levels of TGF-beta RII were detected when compared with the hematopoietic cells of normal donors. Furthermore, this decreased expression was also observed in the other myeloproliferative disorders, polycythemia rubra vera (PRV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET). The leukemia cell lines K562 and HL-60 had no detectable TGF-beta RII mRNA. Two microsatellite regions found altered in RER+ colon cancers were analyzed to establish if these sequences were aberrant in CML. No alteration was detected in either of these regions in any phase of the disease. These results suggest that alterations of the microsatellite regions in the TGF-beta RII gene are not involved in the progression of CML. Decreased expression of TGF-beta RII in CML cells and leukemia cell lines raises the possibility that altered expression of the receptor may play a role in the initiation and/or maintenance of the disease state. </text>

      <text>N-glycosylation of glucose transporter-1 (Glut-1) is associated with increased transporter affinity for glucose in human leukemic cells. To elucidate the role of N-glycosylation in the functional activity of the universal glucose transporter, Glut-1, we investigated effects of the N-glycosylation inhibitor, tunicamycin, on glucose transport by human leukemic cell lines K562, U937 and HL60. Treatment with tunicamycin produced a 40-50% inhibition of 2-deoxyglucose uptake and this was associated with a 2-2.5-fold decrease in transporter affinity for glucose (Km) without a change in Vmax. Leukemic K562, U937 and HL60 cells expressed Glut-1 transporter protein. With K562 cells Glut-1 appeared as a broad band of 50-60 kDa, whereas with U937 and HL60 cells a diffuse band was observed at approximately 55 kDa. Treatment of K562 cells with tunicamycin for 18 h, resulted in extensive loss of the 50-60 kDa glycoprotein, appearance of a 30-40 kDa band and increased staining of a 45 kDa band. With U937 cells, tunicamycin treatment resulted in the appearance of a 30-40 kDa band and increased staining of a 45 kDa band. With HL60 cells loss of the 55 kDa Glut-1 band was observed and a band of 45 kDa appeared. Tunicamycin-treatment resulted in 75-90% inhibition in [3H]mannose incorporation but only 20-25% inhibition in [3H]thymidine and [3H]leucine incorporation. In contrast, tunicamycin had little effect on the viability and MTT responses of the cells used. These results suggest that in leukemic cells N-glycosylation of Glut-1 plays an important role in maintaining its structure and functional integration. </text>

      <text>Decontamination of medical equipment--manufacturer's problems. 1. Small items sent via the post present a much greater hidden hazard and a higher potential for catching people unawares. 2. Large items accompanied by a Decontamination Certificate need to be treated with caution because only those surfaces which are accessible will have been cleaned; as soon as engineers start dismantling equipment, areas which are still soiled become exposed. 3. Total co-operation between hospital staff and service engineers is necessary to resolve these problems-neither can work safely without the assistance of the other. 4. Many products in use in hospitals may be up to 20 years old and clearly were not designed to facilitate decontamination and therefore present far greater risk to all concerned. 5. For the future there a clearly a responsibility with manufacturers to give more thought to the design of their equipment so that decontamination can be achieved more effectively. </text>

      <text>Enterococci at the crossroads of food safety? Enterococci are gram-positive bacteria and fit within the general definition of lactic acid bacteria. Modern classification techniques resulted in the transfer of some members of the genus Streptococcus, notably some of the Lancefield's group D streptococci, to the new genus Enterococcus. Enterococci can be used as indicators of faecal contamination. They have been implicated in outbreaks of foodborne illness, and they have been ascribed a beneficial or detrimental role in foods. In processed meats, enterococci may survive heat processing and cause spoilage, though in certain cheeses the growth of enterococci contributes to ripening and development of product flavour. Some enterococci of food origin produce bacteriocins that exert anti-Listeria activity. Enterococci are used as probiotics to improve the microbial balance of the intestine, or as a treatment for gastroenteritis in humans and animals. On the other hand, enterococci have become recognised as serious nosocomial pathogens causing bacteraemia, endocarditis, urinary tract and other infections. This is in part explained by the resistance of some of these bacteria to most antibiotics that are currently in use. Resistance is acquired by gene transfer systems, such as conjugative or nonconjugative plasmids or transposons. Virulence of enterococci is not well understood but adhesins, haemolysin, hyaluronidase, aggregation substance and gelatinase are putative virulence factors. It appears that foods could be a source of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. This review addresses the issue of the health risk of foods containing enterococci. </text>

      <text>Immunohistochemical analysis of nm23-H1 gene product in node-positive lung cancer and lymph nodes.  The nm23-H1 gene product has been considered as an anti-metastatic protein and the level of its expression has been reported to correlate inversely with metastatic potential in some cancers. However, the expression of nm23-H1 gene product in the metastatic sites have not been studied in detail. We examined the expression of nm23-H1 gene product in surgically resected 46 pairs of primary lung cancers and metastatic lymph nodes by immunohistochemistry. The positive staining of nm23-H1 gene product in primary cancers and metastatic lymph nodes were observed in 56.5 and 67.4%, respectively. The heterogeneity of nm23-H1 gene product expression between primary cancers and metastatic lymph nodes was observed in 41.3%. No correlations were found between the nm23-H1 gene product expression in lung cancers and the patients survival. No significant association was also observed between nm23-H1 gene product expression in lymph nodes and the patients survival. There was, furthermore, no correlation between the heterogeneity of nm23-H1 gene product expression and the patients survival. In conclusion, the level of nm23-H1 gene product expression does not significantly reveal prognostic value in node-positive lung cancers. Expression of nm23-H1 gene product in metastatic lymph nodes was also unrelated to patients survival. </text>

      <text>Bradycardia-induced coronary angiogenesis is dependent on vascular endothelial growth factor. A marked coronary angiogenesis is known to occur with chronic bradycardia. We tested the hypothesis that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an endothelial cell mitogen and a major regulator of angiogenesis, is upregulated in response to low heart rate and consequential increased stroke volume. Bradycardia was induced in rats by administering the bradycardic drug alinidine (3 mg/kg body weight) twice daily. Heart rate decreased by 32% for 20 to 40 minutes after injection and was chronically reduced by 10%, 14%, and 18.5% after 1, 2, and 3 weeks of treatment, respectively. Arterial pressure and cardiac output were unchanged. Left ventricular capillary length density (mm/mm(3)) increased gradually with alinidine administration; a 15% increase after 2 weeks and a 40% increase after 3 weeks of alinidine treatment were documented. Left ventricular weight, body weight, and their ratio were not significantly altered by alinidine treatment. After 1 week of treatment, before an increase in capillary length density, VEGF mRNA increased  greater than 2-fold and then declined to control levels after 3 weeks of treatment. VEGF protein was higher in alinidine-treated rats than in controls after 2 weeks and increased further after 3 weeks of treatment. Injection of VEGF-neutralizing antibodies over a 2-week period completely blocked alinidine-stimulated angiogenesis. In contrast, bFGF mRNA was not altered by alinidine treatment. These data suggest that VEGF plays a key role in the angiogenic response that occurs with chronic bradycardia. The mechanism underlying this VEGF-associated angiogenesis may be an increase in stretch due to enhanced diastolic filling. </text>

      <text>External beam radiotherapy for subretinal neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration: is this treatment efficient? PURPOSE: Control of the natural course of subretinal neovascularization (SRNV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is difficult. Only a subset of patients is suitable for laser coagulation. This prospective study aimed to determine the efficacy and individual benefit of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: The prospective trial included 287 patients with subfoveal neovascularization due to AMD which was verified by fluorescein angiography. Patients have been treated between January 1996 and October 1997. All patients received a total dose of 16 Gy in 2-Gy daily fractions with 5-6 MeV photons based on computerized treatment planning in individual head mask fixation. This first analysis is based on 73 patients (50 women, 23 men, median age 74.3 years), with a median follow-up of 13.3 months and a minimum follow-up of 11 months. RESULTS: All patients completed therapy and tolerability was good. First clinical control with second angiography was performed 6 weeks after irradiation, then in 3-month intervals. Eighteen patients with SRNV refusing radiotherapy served as a control group and were matched with 18 irradiated patients. After 7 months median visual acuity (VA) was 20/160 for the irradiated and 20/400 for the untreated patients. One year after radiotherapy final median VA was 20/400 in both groups. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that 16 Gy of conventionally fractionated external beam irradiation slows down the visual loss in exudative AMD for only a few months. Patients' reading vision could not be saved for a long-term run. </text>

      <text>Increased serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor in patients with renal cell carcinoma. Neovascularization, an essential event for the growth of solid tumors, is regulated by a number of angiogenic factors. One such factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is considered to exert a potent angiogenic activity, as indicated by immunohistochemical and molecular evidence. In this study we investigated the serum VEGF level (s-VEGF) in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). s-VEGF in peripheral blood samples was analyzed in 40 RCC patients and 40 patients without cancer (controls) using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunoassay. In 20 RCC patients, serum samples were obtained separately from the bilateral renal veins. s-VEGF was also measured before, 4 and 8 weeks after nephrectomy in 11 patients. There were significant differences in s-VEGF between the RCC patients and the controls (207.3+/-32.9 vs. 71.5+/-9.1 pg/ml, mean+/-SE) (P less than 0.005), between the tumor-bearing renal veins and the contralateral ones (P less than 0.01), between the pre- and post-nephrectomy situations (P less than 0.01) and among the various parameters of tumor status such as tumor extent (P less than 0.001) and existence of metastasis (P less than 0.001). s-VEGF significantly correlated with the tumor volume obtained by a three-dimensional measurement (r=0.802, P less than 0.0001). The sensitivity and specificity of s-VEGF at the cut-off level of 100 pg/ml, as determined by the receiver-operating-characteristics curve, were 80.0% and 72.5%, respectively. The results indicate that tumor tissue of RCC liberates VEGF into the systemic blood flow and that s-VEGF is a possible marker for RCC. </text>

      <text>Insulin-induced vascular endothelial growth factor expression in retina. PURPOSE: Clinical studies have demonstrated that intensive insulin therapy causes a transient worsening of retinopathy. The mechanisms underlying the initial insulin-induced deterioration of retinal status in patients with diabetes remain unknown. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is known to be operative in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. The current study was conducted to characterize the effect of insulin on retinal VEGF gene expression in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The effect of insulin on VEGF expression in vivo was examined by in situ hybridization studies of rat retinal VEGF transcripts. To examine the mechanisms by which insulin regulates VEGF expression, human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells were exposed to insulin, and VEGF mRNA levels were quantified with RNase protection assays (RPAs). Conditioned media from insulin-treated RPE cells were assayed for VEGF protein and capillary endothelial cell proliferation. The capacity of insulin to stimulate the VEGF promoter linked to a luciferase reporter gene was characterized in transient transfection assays. RESULTS: Insulin increased VEGF mRNA levels in the ganglion, inner nuclear, and RPE cell layers. In vitro, insulin increased VEGF mRNA levels in human RPE cells and enhanced VEGF promoter activity without affecting transcript stability. Insulin treatment also increased VEGF protein levels in conditioned RPE cell media in a dose-dependent manner with a median effective concentration of 5 nM. The insulin-conditioned RPE cell media stimulated capillary endothelial cell proliferation, an effect that was completely blocked by anti-VEGF neutralizing antibody. CONCLUSIONS: Insulin increases VEGF mRNA and secreted protein levels in RPE cells through enhanced transcription of the VEGF gene. Intensive insulin therapy may cause a transient worsening of retinopathy in patients with diabetes through increased retinal VEGF gene expression. </text>

      <text>The antiangiogenic agent linomide inhibits the growth rate of von Hippel-Lindau paraganglioma xenografts to mice. The aim of this study was to ascertain the potential usefulness of the antiangiogenic compound linomide for treatment of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-related tumors. Paraganglioma tissue fragments obtained at surgery from a VHL type 2a patient were transplanted s.c. to male BALB/c nu/nu (nude) mice: (a) 2-3-mm fragments for "prevention" experiments; and (b) 2-3-mm fragments allowed to grow to 1 cm for "intervention" studies. Both groups received either 0.5 mg/ml linomide in drinking water or acidified water and were followed until tumor diameter reached 3 cm or for 4 weeks. In both the prevention and intervention experiments, a significant diminution of tumor size and weight was observed in the drug-treated animals. In vivo nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of tumor blood flow in linomide-treated animals showed localization of blood vessels almost exclusively to the periphery of the poorly vascularized tumors with a significant reduction of both vascular functionality and vasodilation. Histological examination of tumors from linomide-treated animals revealed marked avascularity. Treated animals also displayed a 2.4-fold reduction of tumor vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA levels. Taken together, our data indicate that in VHL disease, therapy directed at inhibition of constitutively expressed VEGF induction of angiogenesis by VHL tumors may constitute an effective medical treatment. </text>

      <text>Phosphatidyl serine exposure during apoptosis precedes release of cytochrome c and decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Time kinetics of phosphatidyl serine (PS) exposure were compared to other apoptotic parameters following different apoptotic stimuli. Our data indicate that anti-Fas treatment of L929sAhFas cells results in rapid exposure of PS, which precedes decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) and release of cytochrome c, indicating that PS exposure occurs independently of these mitochondrial events. Also during TNF-, etoposide- or staurosporine-mediated apoptosis in PC60 RI/RII cells, PS-positive cells were observed before they had a decreased DeltaPsi(m). However, during growth factor depletion-induced death of 32D cells, both phenomena seemed to occur at the same time. </text>

      <text>LMP1 of Epstein-Barr virus induces proliferation of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts and cooperatively transforms the cells with a p16-insensitive CDK4 oncogene.  The latent membrane protein LMP1 of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is often present in EBV-associated malignancies including nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Previous work demonstrates that the LMP1 gene of EBV is sufficient to transform certain established rodent fibroblast cell lines and to induce the tumorigenicity of some human epithelial cell lines. In addition, LMP1 plays pleiotropic roles in cell growth arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis, depending on the background of the target cells. To examine the roles of LMP1 in cell proliferation and growth regulation in primary culture cells, we constructed a recombinant retrovirus containing an LMP1 gene. With this retrovirus, LMP1 was shown to stimulate the proliferation of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF cells). It has a mitogenic activity for MEF cells, as demonstrated by an immediate induction of cell doubling time. In addition, it significantly extends the passage number of MEF cells to more than 30 after retroviral infection, compared with less than 5 for uninfected MEF cells. Furthermore, LMP1 cooperates with a p16-insensitive CDK4(R24C) oncogene in transforming MEF cells. Our results provide the first evidence of the abilities of the LMP1 gene, acting alone, to effectively induce the proliferation of primary MEF cells and of its cooperativity with another cellular oncogene in transforming primary cells. </text>

      <text>Obstructive nephropathy: lessons from cystic kidney disease. Obstructive nephropathy is one of the most important causes of renal failure in infants and children, while polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a major cause of renal failure in the adult population. This review summarizes the evidence that there may be a number of mechanisms common to the pathophysiology of both conditions. In animal models of obstructive nephropathy and PKD, the renal tubular expression of epidermal growth factor is suppressed, and expression of clusterin is increased, both of which suggest arrested maturation or dedifferentiation of the tubular cell. There is a marked increase in apoptosis of epithelial cells in dilated tubules, associated with an increase in apoptotic stimuli. The renin-angiotensin system is activated in both obstructive nephropathy and PKD, which may contribute to tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, which characterize the progression of both conditions. Focal cystic dilatation of the tubule is found in obstructive nephropathy, while tubular obstruction is present in cystic kidney disease. It is therefore likely that elucidation of the effects of mechanical stretch on renal tubular epithelial cells will contribute to our understanding of both conditions. </text>

      <text>Autotaxin (ATX), a potent tumor motogen, augments invasive and metastatic potential of ras-transformed cells.  Autotaxin (ATX), an exo-nucleotide pyrophosphatase and phosphodiesterase, was originally isolated as a potent stimulator of tumor cell motility. In order to study whether ATX expression affects motility-dependent processes such as invasion and metastasis, we stably transfected full-length ATX cDNA into two non-expressing cell lines, parental and ras-transformed NIH3T3 (clone7) cells. The effect of ATX secretion on in vitro cell motility was variable. The ras-transformed, ATX-secreting subclones had enhanced motility to ATX as chemoattractant, but there was little difference in the motility responses of NIH3T3 cells transfected with atx, an inactive mutant gene, or empty vector. In MatrigelTM invasion assays, all subclones, which secreted enzymatically active ATX, demonstrated greater spontaneous and ATX-stimulated invasion than appropriate controls. This difference in invasiveness was not caused by differences in gelatinase production, which was constant within each group of transfectants. In vivo studies with athymic nude mice demonstrated that injection of atx-transfected NIH3T3 cells resulted in a weak tumorigenic capacity with few experimental metastases. Combination of ATX expression with ras transformation produced cells with greatly amplified tumorigenesis and metastatic potential compared to ras-transformed controls. Thus, ATX appears to augment cellular characteristics necessary for tumor aggressiveness. </text>

      <text>Oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor mutants with tandem duplication: gene structure and effects on receptor function.  A number of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) deletion mutants have been identified in gliomas, in which the EGFR gene is frequently amplified and rearranged. We have previously characterized the structure of a gene in A-172 human glioma cells that encodes a 190-kDa EGFR mutant with tandem duplication of the tyrosine kinase (TK) and calcium-mediated internalization (CAIN) domains. Here we describe a 185-kDa tandem duplication mutant (TDM) that is expressed in KE and A-1235 glioma cells, along with certain functional characteristics of the mutants. The corresponding transcripts in KE and A-1235 cells contain 1053 additional nucleotides representing an in-frame duplication of exons 18 through 25 which encode the entire TK region and a portion of the CAIN domain. As with duplication of the entire TK/CAIN region (exons 18-26) in A-172 cells, duplication of exons 18-25 is associated with a specific genomic rearrangement between flanking introns. Involved introns contain homology to recombination signal sequence (RSS) heptamers present in the V(D)J region of the T lymphocyte receptor gene. In defined medium, both oncogenic TDM are constitutively autophosphorylated and inefficiently downregulated. High-affinity binding is reduced in EGFR.TDM/18-26, although the t1/2 of receptor internalization is not prolonged. </text>

      <text>Ciprofloxacin mediated cell growth inhibition, S/G2-M cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in a human transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder cell line.  The second most prevalent urological malignancy in middle aged and elderly men is bladder cancer, with 90% of the cases being transitional cell carcinomas. The success of current systemic and intravesical therapeutic agents, such as cisplatin, thiotepa, Adriamycin, mitomycin C, and bacillus Calmette-Guerin, is limited with recurrence rates reduced to 17-44%. In addition, most of these agents require instrumentation of the urinary tract and are delivered at a significant cost and potential morbidity to the patient. Fluroquinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, which can be administered p.o., may have a profound effect in bladder cancer management. This is primarily based on limited in vitro studies on tumor cells derived from transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder that revealed a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of cell growth by ciprofloxacin at concentrations that are easily attainable in the urine of patients. However, the mechanism(s) by which ciprofloxacin elicits its biological effects on bladder cancer cells is not well documented. Our experimental data confirm previous studies showing the in vitro cell growth inhibition of the transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder cell line HTB9 and further showed the induction of cell cycle arrest at the S/G2-M checkpoints. In addition, we found down-regulation of cyclin B, cyclin E, and dephosphorylation of cdk2 in ciprofloxacin-treated bladder tumor cells. There was also an up-regulation of Bax, which altered the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio, which may be responsible for mitochondrial depolarization reported to be involved prior to the induction of apoptosis. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1 level was found to be decreased within 12 h of ciprofloxacin treatment and disappeared completely when HTB9 cells were treated with 200 microg/ml ciprofloxacin for 24 h. The down-regulation of p21WAF1 closely correlated with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and CPP32 activation. Recent studies revealed that p21WAF1 protects cells from apoptosis by arresting them in G1 and further binds to pro-caspase-3, preventing its activation and thus, inhibiting the apoptotic cascade. Hence, the down-regulation of p21WAF1, together with the alterations in Bax and cdk2 as observed in our studies, may define a novel mechanism by which ciprofloxacin inhibits tumor cell growth and induces apoptotic cell death. The results of our current studies provide strong experimental evidence for the use of ciprofloxacin as a potential preventive and/or therapeutic agent for the management of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. </text>

      <text>Genuine monovalent ligands of TrkA nerve growth factor receptors reveal a novel pharmacological mechanism of action. Developing small molecule agonistic ligands for tyrosine kinase receptors has been difficult, and it is generally thought that such ligands require bivalency. Moreover, multisubunit receptors are difficult to target, because each subunit contributes to ligand affinity, and each subunit may have distinct and sometimes opposing functions. Here, the nerve growth factor receptor subunits p75 and the tyrosine kinase TrkA were studied using artificial ligands that bind specifically to their extracellular domain. Bivalent TrkA ligands afford robust signals. However, genuine monomeric and monovalent TrkA ligands afford partial agonism, activate the tyrosine kinase activity, cause receptor internalization, and induce survival and differentiation in cell lines and primary neurons. Monomeric and monovalent TrkA ligands can synergize with ligands that bind the p75 subunit. However, the p75 ligands used in this study must be bivalent, and monovalent p75 ligands have no effect. These findings will be useful in designing and developing screens of small molecules selective for tyrosine kinase receptors and indicate that strategies for designing agonists of multisubunit receptors require consideration of the role of each subunit. Last, the strategy of using anti-receptor mAbs and small molecule hormone mimics as receptor ligands could be applied to the study of many other heteromeric cell surface receptors. </text>

      <text>Vascular proliferation and enhanced expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase in human peritoneum exposed to long-term peritoneal dialysis. Long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD) is associated with alterations in peritoneal permeability and loss of ultrafiltration. These changes originate from increased peritoneal surface area, but the morphologic and molecular mechanisms involved remain unknown. The hypothesis that modifications of activity and/or expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isozymes might play a role in these modifications, via enhanced local production of nitric oxide, was tested in this study. NOS activities were measured by the L-citrulline assay in peritoneal biopsies from seven control subjects, eight uremic patients immediately before the onset of PD, and 13 uremic patients on short-term ( less than 18 mo, n = 6) or long-term( greater than 18 mo, n = 7) PD. Peritoneal NOS activity is increased fivefold in long-term PD patients compared with control subjects. In uremic patients, NOS activity is positively correlated with the duration of PD. Increased NOS activity is mediated solely by Ca(2+)-dependent NOS and, as shown by immunoblotting, an upregulation of endothelial NOS. The biologic relevance of increased NOS in long-term PD was demonstrated by enhanced nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity and a significant increase in vascular density and endothelial area in the peritoneum. Immunoblotting and immunostaining studies demonstrated an upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mostly along the endothelium lining peritoneal blood vessels in long-term PD patients. In the latter, VEGF colocalized with the advanced glycation end product pentosidine deposits. These data provide a morphologic (angiogenesis and increased endothelial area) and molecular (enhanced NOS activity and endothelial NOS upregulation) basis for explaining the permeability changes observed in long-term PD. They also support the implication of local advanced glycation end product deposits and liberation of VEGF in that process. </text>

      <text>Active hair growth (anagen) is associated with angiogenesis. After the completion of skin development, angiogenesis, i.e., the growth of new capillaries from pre-existing blood vessels, is held to occur in the skin only under pathologic conditions. It has long been noted, however, that hair follicle cycling is associated with prominent changes in skin perfusion, that the epithelial hair bulbs of anagen follicles display angiogenic properties, and that the follicular dermal papilla can produce angiogenic factors. Despite these suggestive observations, no formal proof is as yet available for the concept that angiogenesis is a physiologic event that occurs all over the mature mammalian integument whenever hair follicles switch from resting (telogen) to active growth (anagen). This study uses quantitative histomorphometry and double-immunohistologic detection techniques for the demarcation of proliferating endothelial cells, to show that synchronized hair follicle cycling in adolescent C57BL/6 mice is associated with substantial angiogenesis, and that inhibiting angiogenesis in vivo by the intraperitoneal application of a fumagillin derivative retards experimentally induced anagen development in these mice. Thus, angiogenesis is a physiologic event in normal postnatal murine skin, apparently is dictated by the hair follicle, and appears to be required for normal anagen development. Anagen-associated angiogenesis offers an attractive model for identifying the physiologic controls of cutaneous angiogenesis, and an interesting system for screening the effects of potential antiangiogenic drugs in vivo. </text>

      <text>Neuroblastoma and hepatocyte coculture conditioned media alter apoptosis.  BACKGROUND: Neuroblastoma is a childhood tumor that often displays unusual biological behavior. The tumor may present with widespread metastases that are unresponsive to aggressive treatment. At other times, both the metastases and the primary tumor may spontaneously regress without treatment. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is thought to play a role in the dichotomous behavior of neuroblastoma. We hypothesize that neuroblastoma cells will interact with host tissues to release mediators that affect apoptosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human neuroblastoma cells and human Chang hepatocytes are grown in a noncontact, coculture system. After incubation for 4 days, the medium from the coculture system is collected. Neuroblastoma cells and Chang hepatocytes are then plated separately with the conditioned medium and their own standard growth medium as controls. After 4 days, these cells are harvested and cytospins made for immunostaining. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), Fas ligand, and Bcl-2, are measured with immunohistochemistry. Apoptosis is detected with the TUNEL method. Immunostaining data are interpreted with computer image analysis and reported as stain index. TUNEL data are reported as percentage apoptotic cells. All data are reported as means +/- SEM. Statistical analysis is performed and P &lt; 0.05 considered significant. RESULTS: Chang hepatocytes grown in the coculture conditioned media have an increase in TNF-alpha and Fas ligand. The neuroblastoma cells have a significant decrease in Fas ligand. There is a significant increase in the number of apoptotic hepatocytes when they are cultured in the conditioned media. In contrast, the neuroblastoma cells grown in the coculture conditioned media show no increase in apoptosis. Finally, Bcl-2 is significantly increased in the neuroblastoma cells cultured in the conditioned media. CONCLUSIONS: Neuroblastoma cells grown in coculture conditioned media show increased expression of Bcl-2 and decreased Fas ligand levels. These changes should diminish apoptosis activity in the tumor cells. In contrast, the conditioned media induce elevated levels of proapoptotic mediators in the Chang hepatocytes. A tumor's ability to successfully metastasize may be dependent on mediators generated in the tumor-host interaction, and may not be just an independent characteristic of the tumor itself. </text>

      <text>Neoplastic transformation by Notch requires nuclear localization.  Notch proteins are plasma membrane-spanning receptors that mediate important cell fate decisions such as differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. The mechanism of Notch signaling remains poorly understood. However, it is clear that the Notch signaling pathway mediates its effects through intercellular contact between neighboring cells. The prevailing model for Notch signaling suggests that ligand, presented on a neighboring cell, triggers proteolytic processing of Notch. Following proteolysis, it is thought that the intracellular portion of Notch (N(ic)) translocates to the nucleus, where it is involved in regulating gene expression. There is considerable debate concerning where in the cell Notch functions and what proteins serve as effectors of the Notch signal. Several Notch genes have clearly been shown to be proto-oncogenes in mammalian cells. Activation of Notch proto-oncogenes has been associated with tumorigenesis in several human and other mammalian cancers. Transforming alleles of Notch direct the expression of truncated proteins that primarily consist of N(ic) and are not tethered to the plasma membrane. However, the mechanism by which Notch oncoproteins (generically termed here as N(ic)) induce neoplastic transformation is not known. Previously we demonstrated that N1(ic) and N2(ic) could transform E1A immortalized baby rat kidney cells (RKE) in vitro. We now report direct evidence that N1(ic) must accumulate in the nucleus to induce transformation of RKE cells. In addition, we define the minimal domain of N1(ic) required to induce transformation and present evidence that transformation of RKE cells by N1(ic) is likely to be through a CBF1-independent pathway. </text>

      <text>Alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone modulates activation of NF-kappa B and AP-1 and secretion of interleukin-8 in human dermal fibroblasts. Alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) has evolved as a mediator of diverse biological activities in an ever-growing number of non-melanocytic cell types. One mechanism by which alpha-MSH exerts its effects is modulation of AP-1 and NF-kappa B. These two transcription factors also play an important role in fibroblasts, in extracellular matrix composition, and in cytokine expression. By use of electric mobility shift assays, we demonstrate that alpha-MSH (10(-6) to 10(-14) M) activates AP-1 in human dermal fibroblasts, whereas coincubation with interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) results in suppression of its activation. alpha-MSH also induces activation of NF-kappa B but does not modulate DNA binding on costimulation with IL-1 beta. Since AP-1 and NF-kappa B are key elements in controlling interleukin-8 (IL-8) transcription, human fibroblasts were treated with alpha-MSH and IL-1 beta for 24 hours, and cytokine levels in the supernatants were measured by ELISA. alpha-MSH alone had little effect, whereas coincubation with IL-1 beta led to marked downregulation of IL-8 secretion (at most 288 +/- 152 ng/mL) when compared to treatment with IL-1 beta alone (919 +/- 157 ng/mL). Our results indicate that alpha-MSH exerts modulatory effects on the activation of NF-kappa B and AP-1, and that it can regulate chemokine secretion in human dermal fibroblasts. These effects of alpha-MSH may have important regulatory functions in extracellular matrix composition, wound healing, or angiogenesis. </text>

      <text>CD40 expression on human lung cancer correlates with metastatic spread.  PURPOSE: The poor prognosis associated with lung cancer is related to the high incidence of regional and distant metastasis. There is a crucial need to identify parameters that can predict a tendancy to metastatic spread to allow better prognostic evaluation and therapeutic approach. METHODS: Using flow cytometry we evaluated 18 human lung cancer cell lines for the expression of different surface markers on lung cancers suggested to be possible prognostic parameters, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), Fas and CD40. RESULTS: No correlation was found between tumor prognosis and EGFR, ICAM-1 or Fas. However, a statistically significant correlation was found between the surface expression of CD40 and the metastatic spread of the tumor. In this study, 14 of 18 lung cancer cell lines (78%) expressed CD40 on their surface. All of the 4 tumors that were CD40-negative, were stage I tumors, without any evidence of regional or distant metastasis. Of the 14 tumors that expressed CD40, all but 1 (93%) had either nodal or systemic metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Patients whose tumors were CD40-negative showed a significantly better N stage, overall stage at presentation and survival than those patients with CD40-positive patients. No significant differences between the two groups were observed in tumor size, gender, age, histology, differentiation or preoperative therapy. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that CD40 expression on lung cancer may play a role in metastatic spread, and also may serve as a prognostic marker and an indicator of advanced disease. </text>

      <text>Specific subgroup B adenovirus diagnosis by PCR of the fibre gene. OBJECTIVE: A highly sensitive and specific PCR assay targeting regions of the fibre gene was developed for the identification of subgroup B adenovirus strains. This is critical, since these adenovirus strains are frequently associated with severe respiratory infections in infants and new-borns. METHODS: Clinical samples from nasopharyngeal aspirates were analysed by PCR using several sets of primers corresponding to sequences of the gene coding for the fibre protein. RESULTS: The assay allowed the detection and identification of all the genotypes of adenovirus subgroup B, based on the size of the amplified product when analysed on polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis. Specifically, one set of primers was able to amplify DNA of subgroup B but not subgroup C and E viruses. CONCLUSION: The detection of adenovirus and the genotyping can be done on a routine basis by a PCR assay using the fibre gene as a target. The assay allows the identification of ADV subgroup B, including genotype 7h, which is the single most important viral pathogen associated with respiratory diseases in infants and young children in the southern part of South America. </text>

      <text>The value of serum S-100beta and interleukins as tumour markers in advanced melanoma.  Recently serum S-100beta has shown promise as a tumour marker in melanoma; however, its use as a prognostic marker in the advanced stage needs to be confirmed. Interleukins (ILs) may mediate regression or progression of cancer. In order to study their relation to the metastatic profile and survival, we evaluated the association between pretreatment serum levels of S-100beta, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12 and metastatic site and survival in 50 patients with advanced melanoma who were to receive chemoimmunotherapy. Patients with liver and/or bone metastases had significantly higher median concentrations of S-100beta, IL-6 and IL-10 than those with only skin, nodal and/or lung involvement. The differences in IL-12 levels were unremarkable. Using univariate analysis, the S-100beta level and metastatic profile were found to be statistically significant prognostic factors for survival. Using multivariate analysis the S-100beta level was the most powerful prognostic indicator, while the metastatic profile was found to be significant after exclusion of S-100beta. The findings suggest that elevated serum levels of S-100beta, IL-6 and IL-10 reflect concurrent liver or bone metastases in melanoma. S-100beta is also an independent prognostic marker. Pretreatment IL levels were not associated with outcome. </text>

      <text>TEL, a putative tumor suppressor, modulates cell growth and cell morphology of ras-transformed cells while repressing the transcription of stromelysin-1.  TEL is a member of the ETS family of transcription factors that interacts with the mSin3 and SMRT corepressors to regulate transcription. TEL is biallelically disrupted in acute leukemia, and loss of heterozygosity at the TEL locus has been observed in various cancers. Here we show that expression of TEL in Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells inhibits cell growth in soft agar and in normal cultures. Unexpectedly, cells expressing both Ras and TEL grew as aggregates. To begin to explain the morphology of Ras-plus TEL-expressing cells, we demonstrated that the endogenous matrix metalloproteinase stromelysin-1 was repressed by TEL. TEL bound sequences in the stromelysin-1 promoter and repressed the promoter in transient-expression assays, suggesting that it is a direct target for TEL-mediated regulation. Mutants of TEL that removed a binding site for the mSin3A corepressor but retained the ETS domain failed to repress stromelysin-1. When BB-94, a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, was added to the culture medium of Ras-expressing cells, it caused a cell aggregation phenotype similar to that caused by TEL expression. In addition, TEL inhibited the invasiveness of Ras-transformed cells in vitro and in vivo. Our results suggest that TEL acts as a tumor suppressor, in part, by transcriptional repression of stromelysin-1. </text>

      <text>Caspase-3 is essential for procaspase-9 processing and cisplatin-induced apoptosis of MCF-7 breast cancer cells.  In this study, we sought to investigate in more detail the role of caspase-3 in apoptotic processes in cultured cells and in cell-free extracts of breast cancer cells. We present evidence that apoptosis of caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 breast cancer cells is defective in response to cisplatin treatment, as determined by chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, DNA fragmentation, and release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Reconstitution of MCF-7 cells by stable transfection of CASP-3 cDNA restores all these defects and results in an extensive apoptosis after cisplatin treatment. We further show that in extracts from caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells, procaspase-9 processing is strongly impaired after stimulation with either cytochrome c or recombinant caspase-8. Reconstitution of MCF-7 cell extracts with procaspase-3 corrects this defect, resulting in an efficient and complete processing of procaspase-9. Together, our data define caspase-3 as an important integrator of the apoptotic process in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and reveal an essential function of caspase-3 for procaspase-9 processing. </text>

      <text>Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein is involved in stress-fiber and membrane ruffle formation in endothelial cells. Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) is highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells, where it has been implicated in cellular reorganization during angiogenesis, as well as in endothelial retraction and changes in vessel permeability. However, the cellular functions of VASP are not known. In this study, we have expressed wild-type and mutant forms of VASP in endothelial cells to determine in what aspects of cytoskeletal behavior this protein participates. Expression of wild-type VASP induces marked membrane ruffling and formation of prominent stress fibers in bovine aortic endothelial cells. Deletion of the proline-rich domain of VASP abolishes its ability to bind profilin but does not affect ruffling or stress fiber formation. Further deletions reveal a sequence within the carboxy-terminal domain that is responsible for in vivo bundle formation. Ruffling occurs only on the expression of forms of VASP that possess bundling activity and the capacity to bind zyxin/vinculin-derived peptide. The ability of distinct subdomains within VASP to bind adhesion proteins and induce F-actin bundling in vivo suggests that this protein could function in the aggregation and tethering of actin filaments during the formation of endothelial cell-substrate and cell-cell contacts. These data provide a mechanism whereby VASP can influence endothelial migration and organization during capillary formation and modulate vascular permeability via effects on endothelial cell contractility. </text>

      <text>Urokinase receptor: a molecular organizer in cellular communication. In a variety of cell types, the glycolipid-anchored urokinase receptor (uPAR) is colocalized pericellularly with components of the plasminogen activation system and endocytosis receptors. uPAR is also coexpressed with caveolin and members of the integrin adhesion receptor superfamily. The formation of functional units with these various proteins allows the uPAR to mediate the focused proteolysis required for cell migration and invasion and to contribute both directly and indirectly to cell adhesive processes in a non-proteolytic fashion. This dual activity, together with the initiation of signal transduction pathways by uPAR, is believed to influence cellular behaviour in angiogenesis, inflammation, wound repair and tumor progression/metastasis and open up the way for uPAR-based therapeutic approaches. </text>

      <text>p75 mediated apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells is inhibited by expression of TrkA.  BACKGROUND: Neurotrophins mediate their effects by binding to members of the Trk family of receptor tyrosine kinases and to the low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor p75. Nerve growth factor (NGF) has been demonstrated to support survival and differentiation of neuroblastoma (NB) cells by activation of the TrkA receptor. The p75 receptor belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of death receptors and has been suggested as a receptor that mediates apoptosis in neuronal and NB cells. PROCEDURE: To investigate the effect of p75 expression in NB, we transfected the p75 cDNA into SH-SY5Y cells, an NB cell line lacking expression of both p75 and TrkA. RESULTS: Cell clones expressing elevated levels of p75 showed a high degree of apoptosis even in 10% serum-supplemented medium. Apoptotic signaling by p75 was ligand-independent and only partly caspase-dependent. The level of apoptosis correlated directly with the expression level of the receptor, indicating that p75 may activate the cell death program directly. However, additional transfection of TrkA into SY5Y-p75 cells resulted in a significantly reduced rate of apoptosis even in the absence of NGF. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, expression of the TrkA receptor itself inhibits p75 mediated apoptosis in NB cells. </text>

      <text>RNA damage and inhibition of neoplastic endothelial cell growth: effects of human and amphibian ribonucleases. Angiogenesis defines the many steps involved in the growth and migration of endothelial cell-derived blood vessels. This process is necessary for the growth and metastasis of tumors, and considerable effort is being expended to find inhibitors of tumor angiogenesis. This usually involves screening of potential anti-angiogenic compounds on endothelial cells. To this end, two candidate anti-angiogenic RNA-damaging agents, onconase and (-4)rhEDN, were screened for their effects on endothelial cell proliferation using three distinct types of endothelial cells in culture: HPV-16 E6/E7-immortalized human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), a Kras-transformed HPV-16 E6/E7 HUVEC (Rhim et al., Carcinogenesis 4, 673-681, 1998), and primary HUVECs. Onconase similarly inhibited proliferation in all three cell lines (IC(50) = 0.3-1.0 microM) while (-4)rhEDN was more effective on immortalized HUVEC cell lines (IC(50) = 0.02-0.06 microM) than on primary HUVECs (IC(50) &gt; 0.1 microM). Differential sensitivity to these agents implies that more than one endothelial cell type must be used in proliferation assays to screen for novel anti-angiogenic compounds. </text>

      <text>TRADD domain of Epstein-Barr virus transforming protein LMP1 is essential for inducing immortalization and suppressing senescence of primary rodent fibroblasts.  Mutation analysis of latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced B-cell immortalization revealed two transformation effector sites, TES1 and TES2. TES2 mediates the interaction with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated death domain protein (TRADD) and plays a key role in transactivating NF-kappa B and AP-1. Recombinant EBV containing LMP1 with TES2 deleted induces a limited proliferation of B cells. The present study shows that a mutant with an LMP1 site-specific mutation at TES2, LMP1(TRADD), initially stimulates cell growth and significantly extends the life span of MEF. However, it is not sufficient for the immortalization of MEF, and MEF-LMP1(TRADD) cells eventually enter growth arrest. Further analysis reveals that although LMP1(TRADD) promotes cell growth, it does not prevent the eventual onset of senescence and the expression of tumor suppressor p16(Ink4a). </text>

      <text>IL-12 inhibition of endothelial cell functions and angiogenesis depends on lymphocyte-endothelial cell cross-talk. In vivo IL-12-dependent tumor inhibition rests on the ability of IL-12 to activate a CD8-mediated cytotoxicity, inhibit angiogenesis, and cause vascular injury. Although in vivo studies have shown that such inhibition stems from complex interactions of immune cells and the production of IFN-gamma and other downstream angiostatic chemokines, the mechanisms involved are still poorly defined. Here we show that IL-12 activates an anti-angiogenic program in Con A-activated mouse spleen cells (activated spc) or human PBMC (activated PBMC). The soluble factors they release in its presence arrest the cycle of endothelial cells (EC), inhibit in vitro angiogenesis, negatively modulate the production of matrix metalloproteinase-9, and the ability of EC to adhere to vitronectin and up-regulate ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression. These effects do not require direct cell-cell contact, yet result from continuous interaction between activated lymphoid cells and EC. We used neutralizing Abs to show that the IFN-inducible protein-10 and monokine-induced by IFN-gamma chemokines are pivotal in inducing these effects. Experiments with nu/nu mice, nonobese diabetic-SCID mice, or activated spc enriched in specific cell subpopulations demonstrated that CD4(+), CD8(+), and NK cells are all needed to mediate the full anti-angiogenetic effect of IL-12. </text>

      <text>[Study of fungus polysaccharides compounds (FPC) in inducing the apoptosis of liver cancer cell Bel-7402].  To observe the influence of fungus polysaccharides compounds (FPC) in inducing human liver cancer cell Bel-7402 apoptosis in cell cultivating in vitro, the authors analyzed tumor inhibitive gene P53 expression in Bel-7402 apoptosis by applying double immuno-marker. The result showed that the multilevel of FPC could all apparently induce Bel-7402 apoptosis. With the enhancement of FPC concentration, the authors observed chromatin condensation in some phases companying with the characteristic apoptosis. In the meantime, it could also greatly reduce the G1 and S, with obviously dose-response relationship. The percentage of cell apoptosis increased with the enhancing of concentration. In the high-level group the authors found typical DNA ladder eletrophoresis stripe. The result showed that the mechanism of the FPC antineoplastic effect had an intimate relation with its induction to apoptosis and that the result of FPC inducing tumor cell apoptosis had the character of P53 independence. </text>

      <text>Effects of morphological patterning on endothelial cell migration. The migration of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) plays an important role in vascular remodeling. Here we studied the effects of cell morphology on the migration of bovine aortic ECs by culturing cells on micropatterned strips of collagen matrix (60-, 30-, and 15-microm wide). The spreading areas of the cells on 15- and 30-microm wide strips were 30% lower than those on 60-microm wide strips and unpatterned collagen. The cells on 15-microm wide strips completely aligned in the direction of the strip, and had significantly lower shape index than those in all other groups. On strips of all widths, ECs tended to migrate in the direction of strips. ECs on 15-microm wide strips had highest speed, particularly in the direction of the strip. Vinculin staining showed that the leading edge of ECs on 15-microm wide strips had focal adhesions that were oriented with their lamellipodial protrusion and the direction of cell migration; this arrangement of the focal adhesions may promote EC migration. The present study provides direct evidence on the role of cell morphology in EC migration, and will help us to understand the mechanisms of EC migration during angiogenesis and wound healing. </text>

      <text>Thrombospondin-2 plays a protective role in multistep carcinogenesis: a novel host anti-tumor defense mechanism. The angiogenic switch during tumorigenesis is thought to be induced by a change in the balance of pro- angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors. To elucidate the biological role of the endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin-2 (TSP-2) during multistep carcinogenesis, we subjected TSP-2-deficient and wild-type mice to a chemical skin carcinogenesis regimen. Surprisingly, TSP-2 expression was strongly upregulated in the mesenchymal stroma of wild-type mice throughout the consecutive stages of tumorigenesis whereas the angiogenesis factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, was induced predominantly in tumor cells. TSP-2 deficiency dramatically enhanced susceptibility to skin carcinogenesis and resulted in accelerated and increased tumor formation. The angiogenic switch occurred in early stages of pre-malignant tumor formation, and tumor angiogenesis was significantly enhanced in TSP-2-deficient mice. While TSP-2 deficiency did not affect tumor differentiation or proliferation, tumor cell apoptosis was significantly reduced. These results reveal upregulation of an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor during multi step tumorigenesis and identify enhanced stromal TSP-2 expression as a novel host anti-tumor defense mechanism. </text>

      <text>Relationship of p53 and Helicobacter pylori to clinicopathological features of human remnant stomach cancer after gastric surgery for primary gastric cancer.  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biological features of gastric cancer of the remnant stomach (RSC). Twenty-one patients underwent resection of the remnant stomach for RSC and were divided into two groups: the RSCB group consisted of 11 patients who underwent distal gastrectomy for benign disease and the RSCM group consisted of 10 patients who underwent gastrectomy for primary gastric cancer. The interval between primary surgery and the appearance of gastric cancer in the remnant stomach was significantly shorter in the RSCM group than in the RSCB group. Invasion of adjacent organs was more frequent in the RSCM group than in the RSCB group and the Ki-67 labeling index of the tumors was significantly higher in the former group. Furthermore, p53 overexpression by tumors was almost twice as common in the RSCM group as in the RSCB group. Although there was no significant difference of the H. pylori positivity between the two groups, the rate for both groups was higher than reported in previous studies. Mutation of p53 may play an important role in the high proliferative activity of tumors in the RSCM group and H. pylori infection may be closely related to carcinogenesis in patients with RSC. </text>

      <text>Current prospects for controlling cancer growth with non-cytotoxic agents--nutrients, phytochemicals, herbal extracts, and available drugs. In animal or cell culture studies, the growth and spread of cancer can be slowed by many nutrients, food factors, herbal extracts, and well-tolerated, available drugs that are still rarely used in the clinical management of cancer, in part because they seem unlikely to constitute definitive therapies in themselves. However, it is reasonable to expect that mechanistically complementary combinations of these measures could have a worthwhile impact on survival times and, when used as adjuvants, could improve the cure rates achievable with standard therapies. The therapeutic options available in this regard include measures that: down-regulate serum free IGF-I; suppress the synthesis of mevalonic acid and/or certain derivatives thereof; modulate arachidonate metabolism by inhibiting 5-lipoxygenase, 12-lipoxygenase, or COX-2; antagonize the activation of AP-1 transcription factors; promote the activation of PPAR-gamma transcription factors; and that suppress angiogenesis by additional mechanisms. Many of these measures appear suitable for use in cancer prevention. </text>

      <text>Oncogenic mechanisms of Evi-1 protein.  Although Evi-1 is thought to promote growth or block differentiation in some cell types, its biological functions have not been elucidated. To explore the mechanisms underlying Evi-1-induced oncogenesis, we investigated whether Evi-1 affects the signaling of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), which inhibits proliferation of a wide range of cell types and is one of the most studied growth regulatory factors. We demonstrated that Evi-1 represses TGF-beta signaling and antagonizes its growth-inhibitory effects. Two separate regions of Evi-1 are responsible for this repression, one of which is the first zinc-finger domain. Through this domain, Evi-1 physically interacts with Smad3, an intracellular mediator of TGF-beta signaling, thereby suppressing the transcriptional activity of Smad3. These results define a novel function of Evi-1 as a repressor of signaling components of TGF-beta. We also demonstrated that Evi-1 represses Smad-induced transcriptional activation by recruiting CtBP as a corepressor. Evi-1 associates with CtBP1 through one of the CtBP-binding consensus motifs within the region from amino acid 544 to 607, and this association is required for the efficient inhibition of TGF-beta signaling. A specific histone deacetylase (HDAc) inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), alleviates Evi-1-mediated repression of TGF-beta signaling, suggesting that HDAc is involved in transcriptional repression by Evi-1. This identifies a novel function of Evi-1 as a member of corepressor complexes and suggests that aberrant recruitment of corepressors is one of the mechanisms involved in Evi-1-induced leukemogenesis. These results indicate that specific HDAc inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of Evi-1-induced neoplastic tumors, including myeloid leukemias. </text>

      <text>Antibodies to PAI-1 alter the invasive and migratory properties of human tumour cells in vitro.  Recent reports suggest that elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) may contribute to tumour progression. The studies reported here were designed to help elucidate PAI-1's contribution to the invasive and migratory phenotype. Antibodies to PA-1 dose-dependently, and significantly, inhibited the invasive and migratory potential of human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, as did an antibody to uPA and the plasmin inhibitor aprotinin. Invasion of the human melanoma cell line, BLM, was also attenuated by the anti-PAI-1 monoclonal antibody MAI-12. The non-invasive human melanoma cell line, IF6, which does not express uPA, provided further confirmation of PAI-1 and uPA's role as, upon transfection with uPA, this cell line attained an invasive phenotype, which was again attenuated by MAI-12. Although antibodies to PAI-1 did not affect the adhesion of HT1080 cells to vitronectin, the antibody to uPA reduced their attachment. Addition of exogenous PAI-1, however, prevented HT1080 cell adhesion (IC50 180 nM) and promoted cell detachment from vitronectin. Furthermore melanoma cells transfected with a uPA variant, which had an impaired interaction with PAI-1, were not invasive and had impaired binding to vitronectin. These data highlight the importance of a balanced proteolysis and suggest an additional role for PAI-1 distinct from its role in proteolysis. These data also suggest that uPA and PAI-1 may co-operate in the migratory process by respectively facilitating the attachment to, and subsequent detachment from, vitronectin in the extracellular matrix. These results support the clinical findings and indicate that modulation of PAI-1 activity may be of therapeutic benefit for the treatment of cancer. </text>

      <text>[Anesthetic management of a patient with Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen syndrome]. The Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen syndrome (DMCS) is a rare autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia characterized by short-trunk dwarfism and mental retardation. A 49-year-old male with DMCS underwent resection arthroplasty for contracture of the right hip joint under general anesthesia using thiamylal, nitrous oxide, sevoflurane, and vecuronium. Although he was assumed to have difficult airway due to short neck, macroglossia, and disturbance of neck flexion, tracheal intubation was not difficult. No complications including malignant hyperthermia were observed during the 95 min of the operation. </text>

      <text>Assembly strategies and GTPase regulation of the eukaryotic and Escherichia coil translocons. The translocation of most proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum or bacterial inner membrane occurs through an aqueous pore that spans the membrane. Substrates that are translocated co-translationally across the membrane are directed to the translocation pore via an interaction between the cytosolic signal recognition particle and its membrane-bound receptor. Together the translocation pore and the receptor are referred to as a translocon. By studying the biogenesis of the translocon a number of alternate targeting and membrane-integration pathways have been discovered that operate independently of the signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway. The novel assembly strategies of the translocon and the ways in which these components interact to ensure the fidelity and unidirectionality of the targeting and translocation process are reviewed here. </text>

      <text>Phonology: a review and proposals from a connectionist perspective. A parallel distributed processing (PDP) model of phonological processing is developed, including components to support repetition, auditory processing, comprehension, and language production. From the performance of the PDP reading model of Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg, and Patterson (1996), it is inferred that the acoustic-articulatory motor pattern associator that supports repetition provides the basis for phonological sequence knowledge. From the observation that many patients make phonemic paraphasic errors in language production, as in repetition, it is argued that there must be a direct link between distributed concept representations (lexical semantic knowledge) and this network representation of sequence knowledge. In this way, both lexical semantic and phonotactic constraints are brought to bear on language production. The literature on phonological function in normal subjects (slip-of-the-tongue corpora) and in patients with aphasia is critically reviewed from this perspective. The relationship between acoustic and articulatory motor representations in the process of phonetic perception is considered. Repetition and reproduction conduction aphasia are reviewed in detail and extended consideration is given to the representation of auditory verbal short-term memory in the model. Finally, the PDP model is reconciled with information processing models of phonological processing, including that of Lichtheim, and with current knowledge of the anatomic localization of phonological processing. Although no simulations of the model were run, a number of simulation studies are proposed. </text>

      <text>Inhibition of PDGF-stimulated and matrix-mediated proliferation of human vascular smooth muscle cells by SPARC is independent of changes in cell shape or cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Interactions among growth factors, cells, and extracellular matrix regulate proliferation during normal development and in pathologies such as atherosclerosis. SPARC (secreted protein, acidic, and rich in cysteine) is a matrix-associated glycoprotein that modulates the adhesion and proliferation of vascular cells. In this study, we demonstrate that SPARC inhibits human arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor or by adhesion to monomeric type I collagen. Binding studies with SPARC and SPARC peptides indicate specific and saturable interaction with smooth muscle cells that involves the C-terminal Ca2+-binding region of the protein. We also report that SPARC arrests monomeric collagen-supported smooth muscle cell proliferation in the late G1-phase of the cell cycle in the absence of an effect on cell shape or on levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Cyclin-dependent kinase-2 activity, p107 and cyclin A levels, and retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation are markedly reduced in response to the addition of exogenous SPARC and/or peptides derived from specific domains of SPARC. Thus, SPARC, previously characterized as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor binding to its receptor, also antagonizes smooth muscle cell proliferation mediated by monomeric collagen at the level of cyclin-dependent kinase-2 activity. </text>

      <text>Prognostic significance of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.  Heat shock proteins (HSPs) have been defined as proteins induced by heat shock and other environmental and pathophysiologic stress. Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) is one of the small heat shock proteins. HSP27 is implicated in protein-protein interactions such as folding, translocation, and prevention of inappropriate protein aggregation. Many of their functions suggest that they play important roles in cancers. Archival tissues from 40 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma who received primary surgical resection were examined for HSP27 by immunohistochemistry and correlated with clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, histological grade and survival period. HSP27 expression was positive staining (+) in 20 (50%), weak or negative staining (-) in 20 (50%) of total 40 cases. There was no correlation between HSP27 expression and clinical stage, lymph node metastasis and histological grade. However, when compared with clinicopathological features, the expression of HSP27 correlated inversely with survival period. This study suggests that the expression of HSP27 is frequently promoted in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma and should be considered an independent prognostic factor of oral squamous cell carcinoma patients. </text>

      <text>Novel method for multiturn extraction: trapping charged particles in islands of phase space. A novel method for multiturn extraction from a circular particle accelerator is presented, based on trapping particles into islands of phase space generated by nonlinear resonances. By appropriate use of sextupoles and octupoles, stable islands can be created at small amplitude in phase space. By varying the linear tune, particles can be trapped inside these islands and then transported towards higher amplitudes for extraction. Results of numerical simulations are discussed. </text>

      <text>Upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors is associated with advanced neuroblastoma. BACKGROUND: Angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth and relies on the production of angiogenic factors. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a major regulator of angiogenesis that binds to tyrosine kinase receptors Flt-1 and KDR. The interaction of VEGF and its receptors at gene and protein levels in neuroblastoma remains widely unknown. METHODS: Tumor biopsy specimens and serum were obtained from 37 neuroblastoma patients; adrenal biopsy sections and sera of 7 normal children served as controls. Biopsy specimens were examined by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting; serum was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). VEGF-A(165), B, C, Flt-1, and KDR were analyzed. RESULTS: VEGF isoforms and its receptors' mRNA were expressed in neuroblastoma and control tissues. Whereas the ligands were increased in stages III and IV, the receptors were upregulated in stage III only. At protein level, VEGF-B and C, Flt-1, and KDR were not detectable in tissue lysates, whereas VEGF-A was increased in stages III and IV. Serum VEGF protein levels were upregulated in stage III. CONCLUSIONS: VEGF-A(165) is one of the major angiogenesis regulators among the ligands' family of VEGF, whereas its receptors KDR, and most probably Flt-1, may contribute to a poor prognosis (angiogenic) phenotype, as indicated by their upregulated MRNA levels in stage III neuroblastoma. VEGF-A(165) mainly contributes to increased serum VEGF levels and may serve as a diagnostic tool in advanced-stage neuroblastoma. </text>

      <text>Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 activation by aerobic glycolysis implicates the Warburg effect in carcinogenesis.  Cancer cells display high rates of aerobic glycolysis, a phenomenon known historically as the Warburg effect. Lactate and pyruvate, the end products of glycolysis, are highly produced by cancer cells even in the presence of oxygen. Hypoxia-induced gene expression in cancer cells has been linked to malignant transformation. Here we provide evidence that lactate and pyruvate regulate hypoxia-inducible gene expression independently of hypoxia by stimulating the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible Factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha). In human gliomas and other cancer cell lines, the accumulation of HIF-1alpha protein under aerobic conditions requires the metabolism of glucose to pyruvate that prevents the aerobic degradation of HIF-1alpha protein, activates HIF-1 DNA binding activity, and enhances the expression of several HIF-1-activated genes including erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, glucose transporter 3, and aldolase A. Our findings support a novel role for pyruvate in metabolic signaling and suggest a mechanism by which high rates of aerobic glycolysis can promote the malignant transformation and survival of cancer cells. </text>

      <text>Risk of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia in congenital neutropenias.  Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has had a major impact on the management of "severe chronic neutropenia" (SCN), a collective term referring to congenital, idiopathic, or cyclic neutropenia. Almost all patients respond to G-CSF with increased neutrophils, reduced infections, and improved survival. Some responders with congenital neutropenia and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) have developed myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML), which raises the question of the role of G-CSF in pathogenesis. The issue is complicated because both disorders have a propensity for MDS or AML as part of their natural history. To address this, the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry (SCNIR) used its large database of chronic neutropenia patients treated with G-CSF to determine the incidence of malignant myeloid transformation in the two disorders, and its relationship to treatment and to other patient characteristics. No statistically significant relationships were found between age at onset of MDS or AML and patient gender, G-CSF dose, or duration of G-CSF therapy. What was observed, however, was the multistep acquisition of aberrant cellular genetic changes in marrow cells from patients who transformed, including activating ras oncogene mutations, clonal cytogenetic abnormalities, and G-CSF receptor mutations. In murine models, the latter produces a hyperproliferative response to G-CSF, confers resistance to apoptosis, and enhances cell survival. Since congenital neutropenia and SDS are inherited forms of bone marrow failure, G-CSF may accelerate the propensity for MDS/AML in the genetically altered stem and progenitor cells, especially in those with G-CSF receptor and ras mutations (82% and 50% of patients who transform, respectively). Alternatively, and equally plausible, G-CSF may simply be an "innocent bystander" that corrects neutropenia, prolongs patient survival, and allows time for the malignant predisposition to declare itself. In patients who transform to overt MDS or AML, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only chance for cure. In those with "soft" signs of MDS, such as an isolated clonal cytogenetic change but without other evidence of MDS, or with an isolated G-CSF receptor mutation, there is room for conservative management. One option is to reduce the G-CSF dosage as much as possible, and observe the tempo of progression, if any, to more overt signs of malignancy. </text>

      <text>Stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors in the pineal gland increases the noradrenaline stores of its sympathetic nerves. The administration of isoproterenol decreases the level of serotonin in the rat pineal gland and at the same time it increases pineal noradrenaline. These effects depend on the stimulation of a beta-adrenergic receptor because they are blocked by pretreatment of the animals with propranolol; this drug by itself does not modify either serotonin or noradrenaline levels in the pineal. The elevation of noradrenaline produced by isoproterenol is selective for the pineal because it is not observed in the salivary gland innervated by postganglionic adrenergic fibers from the same origin as pineal nerves. Pineal serotonin is stored in equilibrium in two compartments, i.e., the parenchymal cells and the adrenergic nerves and thus is most probably reduced in both sites. Since noradrenaline and serotonin are detected in pineal nerve vesicles and may coexist in them, the diminution of intravesicular serotonin, by making more storage sites available, probably determines the selective increase of pineal noradrenaline. A similar modification in the ratio of intravesicular amines as a result of the physiological stimulation of pineal beta-adrenergic receptors by the adrenergic neurotransmitter may explain some of the changes observed in the content of pineal amines. </text>

      <text>Simian virus 40 large T antigen and two independent T-antigen segments sensitize cells to apoptosis following genotoxic damage.  The simian virus 40 (SV40) large tumor (T) antigen is sufficient to transform cells in cultures and induce tumors in experimental animals. Transformation of primary cells in cultures requires both overcoming growth arrest by stimulating the cell cycle and blocking cell death activities presumably activated by oncogene-mediated hyperproliferation signals. The study presented here examined the ability of specific regions and activities of T antigen to modulate apoptosis in cells treated with the genotoxic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The results showed that the expression of full-length T antigen rendered rat embryo fibroblasts (REF) sensitive to 5-FU-induced apoptosis. Thus, neither the p53-binding region nor the Bcl-2 homology region of T antigen was sufficient to prevent cell death induced by the DNA-damaging agent. T-antigen-mediated sensitization occurred independently of retinoblastoma protein or p53 and p300 binding. An N-terminal segment containing the first 127 T-antigen amino acids (T1-127) was sufficient to sensitize cells. A C-terminal segment consisting of T-antigen amino acids 251 to 708 (T251-708) also sensitized cells to 5-FU-induced apoptosis. This sensitization did not occur when T251-708 was targeted to the nucleus by inclusion of the SV40 nuclear localization signal. The introduction of mutations into the T-antigen J domain resulted in mutation-specific and variable inhibition of apoptosis. This result suggested that either the structural or the functional integrity of the J domain is required to sensitize cells to apoptosis. Treatment of REF or REF expressing full-length T antigen, an N-terminal segment, or T251-708 resulted in increased expression of the p53-responsive MDM2 gene; apoptosis occurred through a p53-dependent pathway, as p53-null cells expressing these T antigens were resistant to 5-FU-induced apoptosis. Possible mechanisms involved in sensitizing cells to a p53-dependent apoptosis pathway in spite of the ability of T antigen to bind and inactivate the transcriptional transactivating activity of p53 are discussed. </text>

      <text>Optimizing treatment of choroidal neovascularization feeder vessels associated with age-related macular degeneration. PURPOSE: To optimize the method of treating choroidal neovascularization (CNV) associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). DESIGN: Experimental study and interventional case series. METHODS: The parameters associated with locating and then photocoagulating CNV feeder vessels were identified and optimized using published data and data derived from modeling the choroidal vasculature. Based on these optimized parameters, a prototype diagnostic/treatment system was designed that captures high-speed indocyanine green (ICG) angiogram images and facilitates analysis of the images by enhancing visualization of dye movement through CNV feeder vessels (FVs). The system also permits precise aiming and delivery of 810- nm wavelength photocoagulation laser energy to target FVs on a real-time ICG angiogram image of the choroidal vasculature. Target FVs are tracked by a joy-stick controlled laser aiming beam until an intravenously-injected high-concentration ICG dye bolus is observed to enter the target vessel, at which time the laser is fired. Proof of principle of the combined diagnosis/treatment system design for performing dye-enhanced photocoagulation (DEP) in the clinical setting and determination of the minimum DEP laser energy needed to close CNV FVs was made in 11 AMD patients requiring treatment of CNV, but for whom other treatment was not appropriate. RESULTS: Using ICG-DEP, CNV feeder vessels were closed with single pulse laser energy, delivering as little as 0.6 to 1.8 J of energy to the fundus, producing no visible change in the fundus. Successful FV closure was usually indicated immediately by presence of incarcerated ICG dye in the vessel adjacent to the burn site. The prototype system proved relatively easy to operate. After acquiring and interpreting diagnostic angiograms and repositioning a patient in front of the device, feeder vessel DEP and treatment evaluation required 15 to 20 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: Indocyanine green dye-enhanced photocoagulation of CNV feeder vessels, facilitated by use of a device that permits real-time visualization of the choroidal circulation while aiming the treatment laser beam, appears to minimize the amount of energy applied to the fundus and the volume of fundus tissue affected by treatment, compared with other treatment modalities. The combination diagnosis/treatment device should be useful in optimizing FV treatment and in refining and evaluating the efficacy of DEP in future clinical trials. </text>

      <text>Inhibition of angiogenesis by the cancer chemopreventive agent conjugated linoleic acid. Dietary conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has been shown previously to inhibit rat mammary carcinogenesis. In addition to direct effects on mammary epithelial cells,including decreased proliferation and induction of apoptosis, CLA may exert its effects indirectly by inhibiting the differentiation of mammary stromal cells to an endothelial cell type. Specifically, CLA was found to decrease the ability of mammary stromal cells to form complex anastomosing microcapillary networks in vitro on Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm-derived reconstituted basement membrane. This suggested that CLA might inhibit angiogenesis in vivo. To test this possibility, CD2/F(1) mice were placed on synthetic diets containing 0, 1, or 2% CLA for 6 weeks, before angiogenic challenge by s.c. injection with an angiogenic gel substrate (Matrigel pellet assay). After 7 days, the pellets from animals fed the control diet were infiltrated by abundant branching networks of blood vessels with patent lumen-containing RBCs. In contrast, pellets from the CLA-fed animals contained fewer infiltrating cells, which formed limited branching cellular networks, the majority of which had collapsed lumen and no RBCs. Both levels of dietary CLA showed similar effects, with the number of RBC-containing vessels per 20x field decreased to a third of that seen in control. Dietary CLA decreased serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and whole mammary gland levels of VEGF and its receptor Flk-1. Both cis-9, trans-11 and trans-10, cis-12 CLA isomers were effective in inhibiting angiogenesis in vitro in a dose-dependent fashion. The ability of CLA to inhibit angiogenesis may contribute to its efficacy as a chemopreventive agent. </text>

      <text>Molecular characterization of angiogenic properties of human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells. Little is known about the specificity of angiogenic properties of oral cancer cells and the possible mechanisms. Stimulatory effects on proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) characterized the angiogenic properties of oral cancer cells but not normal oral keratinocytes (NOK). ELISA found the presence of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) both in the tested oral cancer cells and NOK. Attenuation of the proangiogenic effects by neutralizing VEGF antibodies suggests VEGF play a key role in the acquisition of the angiogenic phenotype in oral cancer cells. Western blotting of p53 and murine double mutant 2 (Mdm2) together with p53 DNA sequencing analysis indicate that p53 function loss by mutation or overexpression of Mdm2 occurred in all tested oral cancer cells regardless of their etiology. In summary, the angiogenic property of oral cancer cells is mediated by many factors in addition to VEGF and the functional status of p53. </text>

      <text>Impacts of water management options on flows in the Condamine River in Southern Queensland. This paper examines the implications for river flows of a number of water practices and potential management options in the alluvial plains of the Upper Condamine River. It is an intensively cultivated area where irrigation is limited by the availability of water resources. The practice of capturing overland flows was investigated by the development of a model that simulates the performance of clusters of offstream storages up to sub-catchment scale. Management options examined included improvement to on-farm water use efficiency, the suppression of evaporation from open water storages, increasing the depth of those storages, decreasing their number, and improved tailwater return from irrigated land. Impacts of management options were analysed using a catchment scale water allocation model. </text>

      <text>Male role in fertility decisions in Robertsport, Liberia: an experimental exercise for policy formulation. There is a tendency to believe that in African societies men are the dominant decision makers in the family.  In Robertsport, Liberia, there are indications that, with respect to fertility regulation, the dominance of the husband in fertility decisions exists, but it is also apparent that many of these decisions are made jointly by both husband and wife.  Education is particularly influential in the joint fertility decision-making process.  The 100 husbands sampled in 1982 desired a large number of children and had experience with infant and child mortality.  If family planning programs should attain their goals, men should be more involved, than at present, in every aspect of the programs.  Equally important is the urgency for studies related to the role of men in fertility regulation, using adequately large samples. </text>

      <text>Act No. 16.045  of 2 June 1989 prohibiting all discrimination that violates the principle of equality of treatment and opportunities for both sexes in all sectors of labor activity. This Uruguayan Act prohibits discrimination in employment with respect to the following areas, among others: 1) advertising for the provision of positions; 2) selection criteria; 3) recruitment and hiring; 4) evaluation of performance criteria; 5) the right to advancement and promotion; 6) labour stability; 7) social benefits; 8) suspension and dismissal, particularly in cases involving a change of civil status, pregnancy, or nursing; 9) possibilities for professional and technical education or retraining; and 10) remuneration criteria. Reserving places for one sex because of the presence of activities in which the sex of the employee is essential for performance or to comply with international labor treaties does not constitute discrimination.  Nor do compensatory acts designed to promote equality of opportunities and treatment of both sexes in concrete situations. In cases where the provisions of this Act have been violated, specially designated judges will call the parties together and may adopt measures designed to end the situation complained of.  If they deem it necessary, the judges may institute more formal proceedings.  If the measures adopted are not carried out, the person violating the law is subject to a daily fine, as well as administrative penalties set out in Act 15.903 of 10 November 1987.  Adverse decisions may be appealed.  The state is also to undertake educative campaigns to create interest in and understanding of the problems affecting women workers, thus promoting awareness in such workers and their employers of their situation. </text>

      <text>Enforced expression of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-3 affects functional capillary morphogenesis and inhibits tumor growth in a murine tumor model. Homeostasis of the extracellular matrix is a delicate balance between degradation and remodeling, the balance being maintained by the interaction of activated matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and specific tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Up-regulation of MMP activity, favoring proteolytic degradation of the basement membrane and extracellular matrix, has been linked to tumor growth and metastasis, as well as tumor-associated angiogenesis, whereas inhibition of MMP activity appears to restrict these processes. We have used retroviral-mediated gene delivery to effect sustained autocrine expression of TIMP-3 in murine neuroblastoma and melanoma tumor cells in order to further examine the ability of TIMPs to inhibit angiogenesis in vivo. Growth of both histologic types of gene-modified tumor cells in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice was significantly restricted when compared with controls. Grossly, these tumors were small and had few feeding vessels. Histologic evaluation revealed that although tumors overexpressing TIMP-3 had an increased number of CD31(+) endothelial cells, these endothelial cells had not formed functional tubules, as evidenced by decreased vessel continuity and minimal pericyte recruitment. This effect appears to be mediated, in part, by decreased expression of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin by endothelial cells in the presence of TIMP-3 as seen both in an in vitro assay and in TIMP-3-overexpressing tumors. Taken together, these results demonstrate that overexpression of TIMP-3 can inhibit angiogenesis and associated tumor growth, and that the antiangiogenic effects of TIMP-3 appear to be mediated through the inhibition of functional capillary morphogenesis. </text>

      <text>Brn-3a, a neuronal transcription factor of the POU gene family: indications for its involvement in cancer and angiogenesis. Brn-3a, a member of the POU gene family (so-called because of the similarity with the group of transcription factors Pit, Oct, and Unc), was found in neuronal cells engaged in the transcription activity of the p1 and p2 promoters of the most powerful antiapoptotic gene, namely, Bcl-2. The alternative splicing of Brn-3a mRNA produces two molecular forms: a longer, Bcl-2 transactivating form, and a shorter inactive form, lacking 84 AA in the aminoterminus. In neuronal cells, following Brn-3a gene transfection and superexpression, an increase of 30 fold of the Bcl-2 protein occurs, leading to apoptosis protection. However, recent works demonstrate that Brn-3a expression is not restricted to neuronal cells, as its activity was detected also in cancer cells of non-neuronal nature. Looking for mechanisms linking Brn-3a to carcinogenesis, we discuss the role of this transcription factor in influencing Bcl-2/p53 antagonism and Bcl-2/VEGF induction of tumor angiogenesis, concluding this review with a proposal for the oncogenic nature of Brn-3a. </text>

      <text>Roles of cell adhesion molecules in tumor angiogenesis induced by cotransplantation of cancer and endothelial cells to nude rats. Roles of cell adhesion molecules mediating the interaction of cancer and endothelial cells in tumor angiogenesis were investigated using new in vitro and in vivo model systems with a cultured murine endothelial cell line (F-2) and human cultured epidermoid cancer cells (A431). The A431 cells exhibited typical in vitro cell adhesion to the endothelial F-2 cells. The initial step of adhesion was mediated by sialyl Lewis(x) (Le(x)) and sialyl Le(a), the carbohydrate determinants expressed on the cancer cells, and E-selectin expressed constitutively on F-2 cells. Prolonged culture led to the implantation of cancer cells into the monolayer of the F-2 cells, which was mediated mainly by alpha(3)beta(1)-integrin. F-2 cells cultured on Matrigel showed evident tube formation, and coculture of F-2 cells with A431 cells led to the formation of A431 cell nests constantly surrounded by tube-like networks consisting of F-2 cells. This in vitro morphogenesis was inhibited by the addition of anti-sialyl Le(x)/Le(a) or anti-beta(1)-integrin antibodies, which led to the formation of cancer cell aggregates that were independent from the F-2 cell networks. This in vitro morphological appearance was exactly reproduced in the in vivo tumors, which were formed when the mixture of A431 and F-2 cells at the ratio of 10:1 were cotransplanted s.c. into the back of nude rats. The tumors of A431 supplemented with F-2 cells were profoundly vascularized throughout by the tubular structures formed by F-2 cells, the lumen of which contained the host rat blood cells. The tumor mass thus formed was an average 5.8-fold as large as control A431 tumors that were grown without F-2 cells. The co-injection of anti-Le(x)/Le(a) or anti-beta(1)-integrin antibodies produced a marked reduction in the size of A431 tumors, which were not vascularized and accompanied an independent tiny remnant clump of F-2 cells. The size of these A431 tumors did not differ significantly from those of control A431 tumors raised without F-2 cells. These results indicate that the interaction of tumor cells and endothelial cells in orderly tumor angiomorphogenesis is highly dependent on the action of cell adhesion molecules mediating the adhesion of cancer cells to endothelial cells, inhibition of which remarkably retards tumor growth and angiogenesis. </text>

      <text>Identification of Dss1 as a 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive gene expressed in keratinocyte progenitor cells, with possible involvement in early skin tumorigenesis.  This study identifies genes expressed early in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced skin carcinogenesis in genetically initiated Tg.AC v-Ha-ras transgenic mice. Keratinocyte progenitor cells from TPA-treated Tg.AC mice were isolated with fluorescence-activated cell sorting and expression was analyzed using cDNA microarray technology. Eleven genes were identified whose expression changed significantly in response to carcinogen treatment. Deleted in split hand/split foot 1 (Dss1) is a gene associated with a heterogeneous limb developmental disorder called split hand/split foot malformation. cDNA microarray expression analysis showed that the mouse homologue of Dss1 is induced by TPA. Dss1 overexpression was detected by Northern blot analysis in early TPA-treated hyperplastic skins and in JB6 Cl 41-5a epidermal cells. Interestingly, Dss1 expression was also shown to be elevated in skin papillomas relative to normal skins, and further increased in squamous cell malignancies. Functional studies by ectopically constitutive expression of Dss1 in JB6 Cl 41-5a preneoplastic cells strongly increased focus formation and proliferation of these cells and enhanced efficiency of neoplastic transformation of the cells in soft agar. These results strongly suggest that Dss1 is a TPA-inducible gene that may play an important role in the early stages of skin carcinogenesis. </text>

      <text>Downregulation of c-FLIP sensitizes DU145 prostate cancer cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis.  Although DU145 prostate cancer cells are resistant to exogenously applied Fas agonist CH-11 (anti-Fas monoclonal antibody), Fas-resistance can be overcome using a FasL expressing adenovirus (AdGFPFasL(TET)) [Hyer et al., Molecular Therapy, 2000; 2:348-58 (ref.12)]. The purpose of this study was to try to understand why DU145 cells are resistant to CH-11 and determine the signaling pathway utilized by AdGFPFasL(TET) to induce apoptosis in these Fas-resistant cells. Using immunoblot analysis, we show that AdGFPFasL(TET) is capable of initiating the classic Fas-mediated apoptotic pathway in DU145 cells, which includes activation of caspases-8, -3, -7, and -9, BID cleavage, cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and PARP cleavage. In contrast, CH-11 binds to Fas, but is unable to transmit the death signal beyond the plasma membrane suggesting a block at the DISC (death inducing signaling complex). The anti-apoptotic protein c-FLIP (cellular Flice-like inhibitory protein), which has been shown to inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis at the DISC, was down-regulated following AdGFPFasL(TET) treatment prompting us to investigate its role in inhibiting CH-11-induced cell death. Using c-FLIP anti-sense oligonucleotides to down-regulate c-FLIP we sensitized DU145 cells to CH-11-induced apoptosis. These data suggest that c-FLIP may play a critical role in regulating Fas-mediated apoptosis in prostate cancer cells and that modulation of c-FLIP may enhance Fas signaling based therapies. </text>

      <text>Topoisomerase I protein expression in primary colorectal cancer and lymph node metastases.  Topoisomerase I (topo I) is an important target for the treatment of malignant disease, especially colorectal cancer. Because there is little information on the expression of topo I in colorectal tumors, this study evaluated and characterized topo I protein expression in primary colorectal cancer and lymph node metastases and studied the association between topo I protein expression and clinicopathologic data, p53 status, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) status. Immunohistochemistry assay was performed for topo I protein expression in 249 primary human colorectal cancer and 42 paired lymph node metastasis samples. Topo I expression was described as the percentage of cells staining positive for topo I, along with the intensity and localization of the staining. Clinicopathologic data (sex, age, Dukes' stage, differentiation grade, survival status), p53 status, and PCNA status were statistically analyzed for association with topo I protein expression. Topo I expression in paired primary lymph node metastases were studied for concordance. Topo I protein expression was detected in 127 (51%) samples, including 24.4% with &gt;50% positive tumor cells. The majority had nuclear (70.1%) or nuclear and cytoplasmic staining (17.3%). A higher percentage of cells expressing topo I in primary colorectal cancer was significantly associated with advanced age (P =.040). Patients with rectal cancer had greater topo I expression than those with colon tumors (P =.029). No significant correlation was found between topo I protein expression and sex, Dukes' stage, differentiation grade, survival status, p53 status, and PCNA status. Concordance in topo I staining between primary and lymph node metastases was observed in 33 of 42 cases (P =.029). This suggests that the activity of topo I inhibitors will not differ across various tumor stages, pathology, and patient gender. p53 and PCNA status do not appear to influence topo I expression, and topo I has no apparent association with the acquisition of a metastatic phenotype. Topo I expression now needs to be evaluated in patients undergoing topo I-inhibitor therapy, to better define the role of this protein as a predictive marker. </text>

      <text>CXC chemokine receptors in the central nervous system: Role in cerebellar neuromodulation and development. Chemokines and their receptors are constitutively present in the central nervous system (CNS), expressed in neurons and glial cells. Much evidence suggests that, beyond their involvement in neuroinflammation, these proteins play a role in neurodevelopment and neurophysiological signaling. The goal of this review is to summarize recent information concerning expression, signaling, and function of CXC chemokine receptor in the CNS, with the main focus on the developmental and neuromodulatory actions of chemokines in the cerebellum. </text>

      <text>Combined tracheal and esophageal stenting for palliation of tracheoesophageal symptoms from mediastinal lymphoma. Mediastinal lymphoma as a cause of tracheobronchial obstruction is uncommon, and a malignant tracheoesophageal fistula in the setting of mediastinal lymphoma is rare. Malignant tracheoesophageal fistulas are associated with pronounced morbidity and mortality. We describe a patient with mediastinal lymphomatous infiltration resulting in tracheal obstruction, esophageal obstruction, and tracheoesophageal fistula that were successfully palliated with combined airway and esophageal stent placement. </text>

      <text>Regulation of transforming growth factor-beta signaling and vascular diseases. PURPOSE: Members of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta superfamily play critical roles in regulation of various cellular functions. Dysregulation of the signaling mechanisms of the TGF-beta superfamily proteins is associated with clinical diseases such as cancer, fibrotic diseases, and vascular disorders. Therefore, understanding these signaling mechanisms may provide us with novel ways to develop strategies for treating clinical diseases induced by these cytokines. METHODS: This review discusses our current understanding of the mechanisms of TGF-beta signaling, focusing on the roles of TGF-beta in regulation of vascular wall cells and on the regulation of TGF-beta superfamily signals by inhibitory Smads. </text>

      <text>[Expression and mutation of c-kit gene in gastrointestinal stromal tumor].  OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of the expression and mutation of c-kit gene and its relationship with clinical pathology and prognosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). METHODS: Immunohistochemical and PCR-SSCP techniques were used to detect c-kit protein expression and c-kit gene exon 11 mutation in 82 patients with GIST. RESULTS: The positive c-kit protein expression and c-kit gene mutation rates were 97.6% (80/82) and 41.5% (34/82). Correlating the results of these two methods and clinicopathological factors, the c-kit expression and c-kit gene mutation rates were 95.0% (19/20) and 0 in benign GIST, and were 98.4% (61/62), 54.8% (34/62) in malignant GIST. Mutation positive GIST showed higher frequency of adjacent tissue invasion, metastasis and recurrence as compared with mutation negative ones. CONCLUSION: c-kit protein is an important diagnostic marker of gastrointestinal stromal tumor. c-kit gene mutation may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of GIST and also may be a prognostic marker. </text>

      <text>Inhibition of glucose metabolism sensitizes tumor cells to death receptor-triggered apoptosis through enhancement of death-inducing signaling complex formation and apical procaspase-8 processing.  Tumors display a high rate of glucose uptake and glycolysis. We investigated how inhibition of glucose metabolism could affect death receptor-mediated apoptosis in human tumor cells of diverse origin. We show that both substitution of glucose for pyruvate and treatment with 2-deoxyglucose enhanced apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, CD95 agonistic antibody, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Inhibition of glucose metabolism enhanced killing of myeloid leukemia U937, cervical carcinoma HeLa, and breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells upon death receptor ligation. Caspase activation, mitochondrial depolarization, and cytochrome c release were increased under these conditions. Glucose deprivation-mediated sensitization to apoptosis was prevented in MCF-7 cells overexpressing BCL-2. Interestingly, the human B-lymphoblastoid cell line SKW6.4, a prototype for mitochondria-independent death receptor-induced apoptosis, was also sensitized to anti-CD95 and TRAIL-induced apoptosis under glucose-free conditions. Changes in c-FLIP(L) and cFLIPs levels were observed in some but not all the cell lines studied following glucose deprivation. Glucose deprivation enhanced death receptor-triggered formation of death-inducing signaling complex and early processing of procaspase-8. Altogether, these results suggest that the glycolytic pathway may be an important target for therapeutic intervention to sensitize tumor cells to selectively toxic soluble death ligands or death ligand-expressing cells of the immune system by facilitating the activation of initiator caspase-8. </text>

      <text>Rural/urban differences in access to and utilization of services among people in Alabama with sickle cell disease. OBJECTIVE: This study examined relationships between socioeconomic factors and the geographic distribution of 662 cases of sickle cell disease in Alabama in 1999-2001. METHODS: Measures of community distress, physical functioning, and medical problems were used in analyzing utilization differences between individuals with sickle cell disease living in urban and rural areas. RESULTS: Utilization of comprehensive sickle cells disease services was lower for individuals with sickle cell disease living in rural areas than for those living in urban areas. Rural clients reported significantly more limitations than urban clients on several measures of physical functioning. The results also suggest that utilization of services was higher for those with more medical problems and those who lived in high distress areas, although these findings did not meet the criterion for statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusions based on statistical evidence that geographic location and socioeconomic factors relate to significantly different health care service experience bear important implications for medical and health care support systems, especially on the community level. </text>

      <text>Arteriogenesis: the development and growth of collateral arteries. In patients with atherosclerotic vascular diseases, collateral vessels bypassing major arterial obstructions have frequently been observed. This may explain why some patients remain without symptoms or signs of ischemia. The term "arteriogenesis" was introduced to differentiate the formation of collateral arteries from angiogenesis, which mainly occurs in the ischemic, collateral flow-dependent tissue. Many observations in various animal models and humans support that the remodeling of preexisting collateral vessels is the mechanism of collateral artery formation. This remodeling process seems to be mainly flow-mediated. It involves endothelial cell activation, basal membrane degradation, leukocyte invasion, proliferation of vascular cells, neointima formation (in most species studied), and changes of the extracellular matrix. The contribution of ischemia to arteriogenesis is still unclear, but arteriogenesis clearly can occur in the absence of any significant ischemia. It is questionable, whether collateral arteries also form de novo in ischemic vascular diseases. A better understanding of the mechanisms of arteriogenesis will be important for the design of more effective strategies for the treatment of patients with ischemic vascular diseases. </text>

To investigate whether bee venom (BV) induces apoptosis, the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase- mediated dUTP nick end-labeling assay, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, flow cytometric analysis, and DNA fragmentation assay were performed on NCI-H1299 lung cancer cells treated with BV. Through morphological and biochemical analyses, it was demonstrated that NCI-H1299 cells treated with BV exhibit several features of apoptosis. In addition, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) immunoassay were performed to verify whether BV possesses an inhibitory effect on the expression of cyclooxygenase (COX) and PGE(2 )synthesis. Expression of COX-2 mRNA and synthesis of PGE(2) were inhibited by BV. These results suggest the possibility that BV may exert an anti-tumor effect on human lung cancer. </text>

      <text>Prenatal aspects of ascorbic acid metabolism in the albino rat. Transfer of ascorbic acid and/or its derivatives from maternal blood into the fetus was studied during the last week of gestation in the rat. Rats were injected intravenously with [1-14C]-ascorbic acid and the rate of transfer estimated by the concentration and content of label present in placentas and fetuses. At all times studied the concentration of label in the placenta was greater than in the fetus. The highest capacity of the placenta to concentrate label was found on day 15 decreasing to a low at day 19 and again increasing up to day 21. While in the fetuses, the concentration of label per gram of tissue remained remarkably constant throughout the study. The quantity of labeled compounds transferred into the fetus per gram of placental tissue increased between day 15 and day 21 of gestation. </text>

      <text>Possible role of cyclooxygenase II in the acquisition of ovarian luteal function in rodents. The development of the corpus luteum (CL), which involves angiogenesis, is essential for the establishment of early pregnancy. We investigated the roles of the prostaglandin synthases cyclooxygenase (COX) I and COX-II in angiogenesis and progesterone production in the newly formed CL, using inhibitors of the COX enzymes and the gonadotropin-induced pseudopregnant rat as a model. Injection of indomethacin, a nonselective COX inhibitor, on the day of ovulation and the following day decreased serum levels of progesterone, as did injection of the selective COX-II inhibitor NS-398. In contrast, a selective COX-I inhibitor, SC-560, had no effect on serum progesterone concentrations. None of the inhibitors had any effect on the weight of the superovulated ovaries or on the synthesis of progesterone by cultured luteal cells. To determine whether changes in angiogenesis are responsible for the decrease in progesterone synthesis, we measured hemoglobin and CD34 levels in luteinized ovaries following injection of COX inhibitors and measured the relative frequency of cells positive for platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule as a specific marker for endothelial cells. All of these parameters were reduced by the COX-II inhibitors, suggesting that changes in the vasculature are responsible for the decrease in serum progesterone. Histological examination of ovarian corrosion casts indicated that NS-398 inhibited the establishment of luteal capillary vessels following the injection of hCG. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the activity of COX-II is associated with the formation of functional CL via its stimulation of angiogenesis. </text>

      <text>Tumor angiogenesis modulates leukocyte-vessel wall interactions in vivo by reducing endothelial adhesion molecule expression. The expression of endothelial cell (EC) adhesion molecules involved in leukocyte-vessel wall interactions is suppressed in malignancies. In the present study, we investigated in vivo the regulation of leukocyte-vessel wall interactions by the presence of a tumor. By means of intravital microscopy, tumor necrosis factor alpha-stimulated leukocyte-vessel wall interactions were studied in ear skin microvessels of nude mice bearing small human LS174T colon carcinomas and in C57Bl/6 mice bearing murine B16F10 melanomas. Leukocyte-vessel wall interactions were studied both within and outside small tumors growing in the ear, and in ear microvessels of mice with a large tumor growing on their flank. Tumor-free mice were used as controls. Compared with values measured at the edge of the ear and in the contralateral ear, leukocyte adhesion was found to be diminished significantly in vessels inside the ear tumor in both mouse models. This reduction disappeared with increasing distance from the tumor. Surprisingly, the level of leukocyte adhesion in ear venules of mice with a large flank tumor was also reduced significantly. Leukocyte rolling, i.e., the step preceding adhesion, was not influenced by the presence of a tumor in nude mice, but was down-regulated in immune-competent C57Bl/6 mice. Treatment of mice bearing a small ear tumor with a humanized antivascular endothelial growth factor antibody prevented the down-regulation of leukocyte-vessel wall interactions inside the tumor vessels compared with the nontreated group. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis showed that isolated tumor ECs have suppressed levels of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 as compared with ECs from normal mouse tissues. In cultured b.END5 cells the tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced up-regulation of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 was reduced in ECs that were preincubated with basic fibroblast growth factor or vascular endothelial growth factor. The current results may have an impact on the effectiveness of clinical immunotherapeutic treatment protocols, because immune effector cells may not be able to enter tumor tissue. </text>

      <text>Impact of technology on the utilisation of positron emission tomography in lymphoma: current and future perspectives. Positron emission tomography (PET) has now gained a place in the management of patients with cancer, including those with Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Restaging studies and those addressing the monitoring of response to treatment are especially in focus. Most of the knowledge gained has been achieved with dedicated BGO-based PET technology, but there are a number of developments that will impact on the use of this metabolic imaging technique in the investigation of patients with lymphoma. The challenges ahead are determined by the need for high-quality whole-body imaging associated with increased patient throughput and the need to investigate the role of new labelled ligands. The latter are likely to yield new insights into tumour cell characterisation, tumour behaviour and tumour outcome assessment. The study of new radiolabelled ligands will impose further demands for rapid dynamic data acquisition and accurate tracer quantification. Current and future developments in PET technology range from the use of new detector materials to different detector geometries and data acquisition modes. The search for alternatives to BGO scintillation materials for PET has led to the development of PET instruments utilising new crystals such as LSO and GSO. The use of these new detectors and the increased sensitivity achieved with 3D data acquisitions represent the most significant current developments in the field. With the increasing demands imposed on the clinical utilisation of PET, issues such as study cost and patient throughput will emerge as significant future factors. As a consequence, low-cost units are being offered by the manufacturers through the utilisation of gamma camera-based SPET systems for PET coincidence imaging. Unfortunately, clinical studies in lymphoma and other cancers have already demonstrated the limitations of this technology, with 20% of lesions &lt;15 mm in size escaping detection. On the other hand, the recent development of combined PET/CT devices attempts to address the lack of anatomical information inherent with PET images, taking advantage of further improvement in patient throughput and hence cost-effectiveness. Preliminary studies using this multimodality imaging approach have already demonstrated the potential of the technique. Although the potential exists, certain technical issues with PET/CT require refinement of the methodology. Such issues include organ movement (such as respiratory motion), which strongly influences the image fusion of a rapidly acquired CT scan with the slower acquisition of a PET dataset, and the derivation of CT-based attenuation coefficients in the presence of contrast agents or metallic implants. The application of the technology for radiotherapy planning also poses a number of associated challenges. Finally, the development of dedicated PET systems based on planar detector arrangements with new detector components has the potential to improve clinical throughput by over 100%, but clinical trials using such systems have still to be carried out in order to establish the associated whole-body image quality. </text>

      <text>[Effects of Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 1(EBV-LMP1) on related factors of metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line CNE1].  BACKGROUND &amp;#38; OBJECTIVE: It has been proved that Epstein- Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (EBV-LMP1) can induce the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). This study was designed to investigate the effect of EBV-LMP1 on related factors of metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line CNE1. METHODS: Expression of MMP-9 was studied in human NPC cell lines cultured in vitro: CNE1 (well differentiated cell line of NPC) and CNE1-GL (CNE1 cell line transfected with an eukaryotic LMP1-expression plasmid) by SP immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Cell-matrix adhesion assay was used to study the adhesive ability of CNE1-GL cells. The effects of LMP1 on the invasion and migration of CNE1 cells were investigated by transwell methods. RESULTS: MMP-9 was expressed in both cell lines but the intensity of the staining was different. The positive rates of expression of MMP-9 in CNE1 and CNE1-GL cells were 30.2% and 98.2%, respectively (P&lt; 0.05). The increased expression of MMP-9 was also shown in CNE1-GL cells by Western blot analysis. Cell-matrix adhesion assay showed that the adhesive ability of CNE1-GL with the matrix (mean A value: 1.2508+/-0.0711) was higher than that of CNE1 cell (mean A value: 0.9519+/-0.068) (P&lt; 0.001). Invasion assay and migration assay showed that the invasion and migration of CNE1-GL cell were higher than those of CNE1 cells (P&lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: The transfection of LMP1 can increase the expression of MMP-9 in CNE1 cells. Abilities of adhesion, migration, and invasion of CNE1 cell were induced by LMP1. It is suggested that MMP-9 may have a role in the LMP1-induced acceleration of invasion and metastasis of NPC cells. </text>

      <text>Truncated galectin-3 inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in orthotopic nude mouse model of human breast cancer.  PURPOSE: The goal of this research was to evaluate a potential therapeutic agent for breast cancer based on galectin-3 that has been implicated in tumorigenicity and metastasis of breast cancer. The hypothesis was that therapy with NH(2)-terminally truncated form of galectin-3 (galectin-3C) will be efficacious for reduction in tumor growth and for inhibition of metastases. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Recombinant human galectin-3 was produced in Escherichia coli from which galectin-3C was derived by collagenase enzyme digestion. Toxicity, pharmacokinetic, and organ biodistribution studies were performed in nude mice. For efficacy studies, nude mice bearing orthotopically implanted tumors derived from breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-435 were treated with galectin-3C or a vehicle control i.m. twice daily for 90 days. RESULTS: The maximum tolerated dose of galectin-3C in nude mice was determined to be &gt;125 mg/kg without overt adverse effects. The elimination half-life when administered i.m. was found to be 3.0 h in the serum and 4.3 h in the cellular fraction of the blood. Organ biodistribution studies revealed that galectin-3C localized in the liver, kidneys, and spleen but not in the heart or lungs. We found that the mean tumor volumes and weights were statistically significantly less in mice treated with galectin-3C compared with control mice, and that fewer numbers of mice exhibited lymph node metastases in the treated group compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Galectin-3C is not overtly toxic, and is efficacious in reducing metastases and tumor volumes and weights in primary tumors in an orthotopic nude mouse model of human breast cancer. </text>

      <text>[Screening and identification of novel genes involved in biosynthesis of ginsenoside in Panax ginseng plant]. The root of Panax ginseng plant undergoes a specific developmental process to become a biosynthesis and accumulation organ for ginsenosides. To identify and analyze genes involved in the biosynthesis of ginsenoside, suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) between mRNAs of 4- and 1-year-old root tissues was performed, and a subtracted cDNA library specific to 4-year-old roots was constructed. Forty cDNA clones selected randomly from the subtracted cDNA library were sequenced. Sequence information of all clones was evaluated by Nucleotide Blast analysis in GenBank/DDBJ/EMBL. The results showed that six subtracted cDNA clones represented the novel genes (ESTs), because no sequence homology with any known sequences was found in the database. Expression in 4-year-old P. ginseng root tissues was verified by reverse Northern dot hybridization for the six clones. These six novel genes were named GBR1, GBR2, GBR3, GBR4, GBR5, and GBR6, and their Accession numbers of GenBank are AF485334, AF485335, AF485336, AF485337, AF485332, and AF485333, respectively. Finally, Northern blot analysis and semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed that these six novel genes were differentially expressed in the defined development stage of P. ginseng plant roots. It is possible that their overexpression may play an important role in the ginsenoside biosynthesis. In addition, most of transcripts of all genes could also be detected in other P. ginseng plant tissues such as stem, leaf and seed. Our results provided a basis for obtaining the full-length cDNA sequences of such six novel genes, and for identifying their function involved in the biosynthesis of ginsenoside. </text>

      <text>Prognostic value of p53 protein expression and vascular endothelial growth factor expression in resected squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. The most common genetic alterations found in a wide variety of cancers are p53 tumor suppressor gene mutations. p53 appears to be a nuclear transcription factor that plays a role in the control of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and the maintenance of genetic stability. Angiogenesis is a critical process in solid tumor growth and metastasis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a recently identified growth factor with significant angiogenic properties, may be a major tumor angiogenesis regulator. Few studies have investigated the association between p53 and VEGF expressions and prognosis in esophageal carcinoma. Forty-seven specimens resected from patients with stage II and III squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus were studied using immunohistochemical staining. VEGF and p53 expressions were observed in 40% and 53% of the tumors, respectively. The p53 and VEGF staining statuses were coincident in only 21% of the tumors, and no significant correlation was found between p53 and VEGF statuses. No clinicopathologic factors were significantly correlated with p53 or VEGF expression. No significant association between p53 and VEGF expressions and poor prognosis was found. In conclusion, p53 and VEGF were not correlated with prognosis in patients with stage II and III SCC of the esophagus. </text>

      <text>The role of organ vascularization and lipoplex-serum initial contact in intravenous murine lipofection. Following intravenous administration of cationic lipid-DNA complexes (lipoplexes) into mice, transfection (lipofection) occurs predominantly in the lungs. This was attributed to high entrapment of lipoplexes in the extended lung vascular tree. To determine whether lipofection in other organs could be enhanced by increasing the degree of vascularization, we used a transgenic mouse model with tissue-specific angiogenesis in liver. Tail vein injection of N-(1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTAP)/cholesterol lipoplexes resulted in increased lipoplex entrapment in hypervascularized liver but did not boost luciferase expression, suggesting that lipoplex delivery is not a sufficient condition for efficient organ lipofection. Because the intravenously injected lipoplexes migrated within seconds to lungs, we checked whether the effects of immediate contact with serum correlate with lung lipofection efficiency of different DOTAP-based formulations. Under conditions mimicking the injection environment, the lipoplex-serum interaction was strongly dependent on helper lipid and ionic strength: lipoplexes prepared in 150 mM NaCl or lipoplexes with high ( greater than 33 mol%) cholesterol were found to aggregate immediately. This aggregation process was irreversible and was inversely correlated with the percentage of lung cells that took up lipoplexes and with the efficiency of lipofection. No other structural changes in serum were observed for cholesterol-based lipoplexes. Dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine-based lipoplexes were found to give low expression, apparently because of an immediate loss of integrity in serum, without lipid-DNA dissociation. Our study suggests that efficient in vivo lipofection is the result of cross-talk between lipoplex composition, interaction with serum, hemodynamics, and target tissue "susceptibility" to transfection. </text>

      <text>Stereoselective synthesis of 1-aminoalkanephosphonic acids with two chiral centers and their activity towards leucine aminopeptidase. The stereoselective synthesis of 1-amino-2-alkylalkanephosphonic acids, namely, compounds bearing two chiral centers, was achieved by the condensation of hypophosphorous acid salts of (R)(+) or (S)(-)-N-alpha-methylbenzylamine with the appropriate aldehydes in isopropanol. Simultaneous deprotection and oxidation by the action of bromine water provided equimolar mixtures of the RS:RR and SR:SS diastereomers of desired acids. They appeared to act as moderate inhibitors of kidney leucine aminopeptidase with potency dependent on the absolute configuration of both centers of chirality. </text>

      <text>Proliferative diabetic retinopathy is associated with a low level of the natural ocular anti-angiogenic agent pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) in aqueous humor. a pilot study. Retinopathy is the most common microvascular diabetes complication and represents a major threat to the eyesight. The aim of this study was to address the role of pro- and anti-angiogenic molecules in diabetic retinopathy in the aqueous humor of the eye. Aqueous humor was collected at cataract surgery from 19 diabetic patients and from 13 age- and sex-matched normoglycemic controls. Levels of pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiogenic inhibitor pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) were determined. Angiogenic activity of the aqueous humor was quantified by measuring its effect on the migration of capillary endothelial cells. In the aqueous fluid, VEGF levels were increased in diabetics (mean values: 501 vs. 367 pg/ml; p = 0.05), compared to controls. PEDF was found to be decreased in diabetics (mean values: 2080 vs. 5780 ng/ml; p = 0.04) compared to controls. In seven diabetic patients with proliferative retinopathy, the most profound finding was a significant decrease of the PEDF level (mean value: 237 ng/ml), whereas VEGF levels were comparable to diabetic patients without proliferation (mean value: 3153; p = 0.003). Angiogenic activity in samples of patients from the control group was generally inhibitory due to PEDF, and inhibition was blocked by neutralizing antibodies to PEDF. Likewise, in diabetics without proliferation, angiogenic activity was also blocked by antibodies to PEDF. We will demonstrate here that the level of the natural ocular anti-angiogenic agent PEDF is inversely associated with proliferative retinopathy. PEDF is an important negative regulator of angiogenic activity of aqueous humor. Our data may have implications for the development of novel regimens for diabetic retinopathy. </text>

      <text>Expression of osteoprotegerin and RANK ligand in breast cancer bone metastasis.  Bone destruction is primarily mediated by osteoclastic bone resorption, and cancer cells stimulate the formation and activation of osteoclasts next to metastatic foci. Accumulating evidences indicate that receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL) is the ultimate extracellular mediator that stimulates osteoclast differentiation into mature osteoclasts. In contrast, osteoprotegerin (OPG) inhibits osteoclast development. In order to elucidate a mechanism for cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis, cells from a human breast cancer line, MDA-MB-231, were directly co-cultured with ST2, MC3T3-E1, or with primary mouse calvarial cells. Osteoclast-like cells and tartarate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activities were then quantitated. We examined these cell lines and samples from breast cancer by RT-PCR for the expressions of OPG and RANKL mRNA. Compared to controls, co-culture of MDA-MB-231 cells with stromal or osteoblastic cells induced an increase in number of osteoclasts and TRAP activities. MDA-MB-231 cells alone or breast cancer samples did not express RANKL mRNA. However, co-culture of these cancer cells with stromal or osteoblastic cells induced RANKL mRNA expression and decreased OPG mRNA expression. These experiments demonstrate that direct interactions between breast cancer and stromal or osteoblastic cells induce osteoclastogenesis in vitro through modulating RANKL expression. </text>

      <text>[Community intervention on hypertension and stroke]. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the community-based intervention on reduction of hypertension and stroke in different age groups and subtypes hypertension. METHODS: In 6 cities, 2 geographically separated communities with a registered population about 10 000 of each were selected as either intervention or control communities. A cohort containing 2 700 subjects, 35 years or older, and free of stroke were sampled from each community. The baseline survey was conducted to screen the subjects for intervention. In each city, a program for control of hypertension, heart diseases and diabetes was initiated in the intervention cohort and health education was provided to the whole intervention community. A follow-up survey was conducted 3 years later. RESULTS: Within 3 years, the prevalence of hypertension increased in both intervention and control cohorts, as well as in the middle and elderly cohorts, especially in the middle aged in control group. Among hypertensives in the intervention cohort, the rates of awareness, treatment and control of hypertension got improved. The incidence of stroke was 29% lower (HR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.58 - 0.87) and mortality of stroke was 40% lower (HR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.42 - 0.86) in the intervention cohort than the control cohort. The intervention was most effective in reduction of stroke for those with isolated systolic hypertension and combined systolic and diastolic hypertension (All P &lt; 0.05). Meanwhile, all-cause mortality was 11% lower (HR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.78 - 0.99) in the intervention cohort than in the control cohort. CONCLUSION: The community-based intervention was effective in controlling the development of hypertension and stroke, while the elderly people benefit more than the middle aged people from the intervention. </text>

      <text>Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist inhibits ischaemic and excitotoxic neuronal damage in the rat. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) synthesis in the brain is stimulated by mechanical injury and IL-1 mimics some effects of injury, such as gliosis and neovascularization. We report that neuronal death resulting from focal cerebral ischaemia (middle cerebral artery occlusion, 24 h) is significantly inhibited (by 50%) in rats injected with a recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra, 10 micrograms, icv 30 min before and 10 min after ischaemia). Excitotoxic damage due to striatal infusion of an NMDA-receptor agonist (cis-2,4-methanoglutamate) was also markedly inhibited (71%) by injection of the IL-1ra. These data indicate that endogenous IL-1 is a mediator of ischaemic and excitotoxic brain damage, and that inhibitors of IL-1 action may be of therapeutic value in the treatment of acute or chronic neuronal death. </text>

      <text>Transcriptional and post-translation regulation of the Tie1 receptor by fluid shear stress changes in vascular endothelial cells. The interaction between the vascular endothelium and hemodynamic forces (and more specifically, fluid shear stress), induced by the flow of blood, plays a major role in vascular remodeling and in new blood vessels formation via a process termed arteriogenesis. Tie1 is an orphan tyrosine kinase receptor expressed almost exclusively in endothelial cells and is required for normal vascular development and maintenance. The present study demonstrates that Tie1 expression is rapidly down-regulated in endothelial cells exposed to shear stress, and more so to shear stress changes. This down-regulation is accompanied by a rapid cleavage of Tie1 and binding of the cleaved Tie1 45 kDa endodomain to Tie2. The rapid cleavage of Tie1 is followed by a transcriptional down-regulation in response to shear stress. The activity of the Tie1 promoter is suppressed by shear stress and by tumor necrosis factor alpha. Shear stress-induced transcriptional suppression of Tie1 is mediated by a negative shear stress response element, localized in a region of 250 bp within the promoter. The rapid down-regulation of Tie1 by shear stress changes and its rapid binding to Tie2 may be required for destabilization of endothelial cells in order to initiate the process of vascular restructuring. </text>

      <text>Therapeutic angiogenesis: a complex problem requiring a sophisticated approach. Blood and vascular disorders underlie a plethora of pathologic conditions and are the single most frequent cause of human disease. Ischemia, involving restricted blood flow to tissues is the most common consequence of vessel dysfunction resulting in the disruption of oxygen and nutrient delivery and the accumulation of waste metabolites. Cells cannot survive extended severe ischemia but may be able to adapt to a moderate condition where diffusion to and from bordering nonischemic regions sustains vital functions. Under this condition, the secondary functions of effected cells are likely to be impaired, and a new metabolic equilibrium is established, determined by the level of cross-diffusion and degree of hypoxia. In tissues with a normally high metabolic turnover such as skeletal and cardiac muscle, even mild ischemia causes hypoxia, acidosis, and depressed function (contractility) and eventually threatens myocyte viability and organ function. Ischemic cardiac muscle is additionally vulnerable because reperfusion is essential for survival but reperfusion itself poses additional stress principally from increased production of free radicals during reoxygenation. The latter effect is called reperfusion injury and can cause as much damage as the ischemia. The treatment possibilities for ischemia-related vascular disease are limited. Lipid/cholesterol-lowering agents, diet and antiplatelet adherence (aspirin) therapy may help slow the progression of vessel disease in some instances; but surgical reconstruction may be the only option in advanced stages, and even this is not always an option. An alternative and rather obvious strategy to treat ischemia is to activate endogenous angiogenic or arteriogenic pathways to stimulate revascularization of the tissue. The feasibility of such a strategy has now been established through the results of studies over the past decade, and a new discipline called therapeutic angiogenesis has emerged. This review focuses on the application of therapeutic angiogenesis for treating ischemic muscle disease and includes a critical evaluation of the parameters and limitations of current procedures. The development of this technology has benefited from its application to both peripheral and coronary artery disease and results from both are reviewed here. </text>

      <text>Expression, regulation, and function of IGF-1, IGF-1R, and IGF-1 binding proteins in blood vessels. The vascular insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 system includes the IGFs, the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), and multiple binding proteins. This growth factor system exerts multiple physiologic effects on the vasculature through both endocrine and autocrine/paracrine mechanisms. The effects of IGF-1 are mediated principally through the IGF-1R but are modulated by complex interactions with multiple IGF binding proteins that themselves are regulated by phosphorylation, proteolysis, polymerization, and cell or matrix association. During the last decade, a significant body of evidence has accumulated, indicating that expression of the components of the IGF system are regulated by multiple factors, including growth factors, cytokines, lipoproteins, reactive oxygen species, and hemodynamic forces. In addition, cross-talk between the IGF system and other growth factors and integrin receptors has been demonstrated. There is accumulating evidence of a role for IGF-1 in multiple vascular pathologies, including atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis, angiogenesis, and diabetic vascular disease. This review will discuss the regulation of expression of IGF-1, IGF-1R, and IGF binding proteins in the vasculature and summarize evidence implicating involvement of this system in vascular diseases. </text>

      <text>Microvascular density and vascular endothelial growth factor immunoreactivity as predictors of regional lymph node metastasis from betel-associated oral squamous cell carcinoma.  PURPOSE: Neovascularization has profound effects on tumor growth and metastasis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a mitogen that acts exclusively on endothelial cells. The roles of miscrovascularity density (MVD) and VEGF expression in the progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) have been controversial. The purpose of the present study was to measure the MVD and VEGF expression in a cohort of patients with betel-associated OSCC and to evaluate for possible clinicopathologic correlations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The paraffin sections from 49 subjects with OSCC were subjected to immunohistochemical studies to measure the highest MVD (h-MVD) and cytoplasmic immunoreactivity of VEGF. The findings in the tissue samples were analyzed with regard to the patients' risk factors and clinical course. RESULTS: The OSCC samples had an average h-MVD score of 27.7/mm(2). VEGF immunoreactivity was positive in 75.5% of samples. Both h-MVD and VEGF immunoreactivity were statistically associated with lymph node metastasis (P =.012 and.037, respectively). A marginally significant association was also noted between the h-MVD and patient survival (P =.056). The age and oral habits of patients, as well as the tumor site and size, did not appear to be correlated with h-MVD or VEGF immunoreactivity. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that both h-MVD and VEGF immunoreactivity may be useful predictors for the progression of a subset of OSCC associated mostly with betel use. Antiangiogenesis therapy might have a role in reducing regional metastasis. </text>

      <text>Promotion of tumorigenesis by heterozygous disruption of the beclin 1 autophagy gene.  Malignant cells often display defects in autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved pathway for degrading long-lived proteins and cytoplasmic organelles. However, as yet, there is no genetic evidence for a role of autophagy genes in tumor suppression. The beclin 1 autophagy gene is monoallelically deleted in 40-75% of cases of human sporadic breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer. Therefore, we used a targeted mutant mouse model to test the hypothesis that monoallelic deletion of beclin 1 promotes tumorigenesis. Here we show that heterozygous disruption of beclin 1 increases the frequency of spontaneous malignancies and accelerates the development of hepatitis B virus-induced premalignant lesions. Molecular analyses of tumors in beclin 1 heterozygous mice show that the remaining wild-type allele is neither mutated nor silenced. Furthermore, beclin 1 heterozygous disruption results in increased cellular proliferation and reduced autophagy in vivo. These findings demonstrate that beclin 1 is a haplo-insufficient tumor-suppressor gene and provide genetic evidence that autophagy is a novel mechanism of cell-growth control and tumor suppression. Thus, mutation of beclin 1 or other autophagy genes may contribute to the pathogenesis of human cancers. </text>

      <text>Effects of dietary folate on ulcerative colitis-associated colorectal carcinogenesis in the interleukin 2- and beta(2)-microglobulin-deficient mice.  Folate supplementation may reduce the risk of colorectal dysplasia and cancer in subjects with chronic ulcerative colitis (UC). The interleukin (IL) 2- and beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m)-deficient (IL-2(null) x beta(2)m(null)) mice spontaneously develop colon cancer in the setting of chronic UC. This study investigated the effects of dietary folate on the development of UC-associated colon cancer in the IL-2(null) x beta(2)m(null) mice. Weaning IL-2(null) x beta(2)m(null) mice were randomized to receive 0 (deficient; n = 40), 2 (basal requirement; control; n = 46), or 8 (supplemented; n = 36) mg folate/kg diet for 32 weeks. At necropsy, all macroscopic colonic tumors were identified and histologically classified as dysplasia or adenocarcinoma. The incidence of high-grade lesions (high-grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ and invasive adenocarcinoma) in the folate-supplemented group was 46% lower than that in the control group (35.3% versus 65.1%, P = 0.009). The incidence of high-grade lesions in the folate-deficient group was also 49% lower than that in the control group (33.3% versus 65.1%, P = 0.007). The higher mortality rate in the folate-deficient group compared with the other two groups (25% versus 6.5% and 5.6%, P &lt; 0.02) partially accounted for the low incidence of high-grade lesions in this group. These data indicate that dietary folate supplementation at 4x the basal dietary requirement significantly suppresses UC-associated colorectal carcinogenesis in the IL-2(null) x beta(2)m(null) mice. These data also suggest that folate deficiency may inhibit colorectal carcinogenesis in chronic UC. However, the high mortality observed in the folate-deficient group precludes a definitive conclusion concerning the effect of folate deficiency on UC-associated colorectal carcinogenesis in this model. </text>

      <text>[Laboratory diagnostics of Crimean hemorrhagic fever by polymerase chain reaction]. Our group developed, within the present case study, two techniques' variations, i.e. a single-step RT-PCR and nested RT-PCR assays, for the purpose of detecting the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever RNA virus in human samples. The above assays as well as those previously recommended by the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation were simultaneously used in 14 clinical samples obtained from patients with Crimean hemorrhagic fever. After assessing the detection accuracy, it was found that the developed-by-us test system displayed the same or even better diagnostic values versus the previously recommended nested RT-PCR and a 1000-fold advantage over the previously recommended single-step RT-PCA. The single-step RT-PCR assay variation is always more preferable in sense of technical and economic motivations. Finally, the test system developed by us has every reason to become the method of choice in routine PCR diagnosis of Crimean hemorrhagic fever after all official trials and approvals are duly complied with. </text>

      <text>Prognostic significance and correlation with survival of bcl-2 and TGF-beta RII in colon cancer. Bcl-2 and TGF-beta receptors type II (RII) in colon carcinomas were studied in a series of 113 patients, to determine their prognostic significance and to correlate their expression with other prognostic indicators. Bcl-2 expression in the tumor cells showed a reverse relation with tumor size (P = 0.018), histological grade (P = 0.04), and stage (P = 0.013). Univariate survival analysis using the log rank test showed that the survival of patients with bcl-2-positive tumors was significantly better than the survival of patients with bcl-2-negative tumors (P = 0.02). However, when entered into a multivariate analysis model, it was not found to be of independent prognostic significance. TGF-beta RII expression was correlated with stage (P = 0.03), while no statistically significant correlation was found between TGF-beta RII expression and histological grade or survival. In conclusion, these results provide additional evidence for the role of bcl-2 and TGF-beta RII in carcinogenesis of the colon, while they do not support the use of these factors as prognostic markers in patients with colon cancer. </text>

      <text>Antibiotic-induced persistence of cytotoxic Staphylococcus aureus in non-phagocytic cells. OBJECTIVES: After infection of non-phagocytic cells, some Staphylococcus aureus strains are able to survive and kill their host cells. The purpose of this study was to determine the action of various antibiotics on the survival of host cells and/or intracellular S. aureus. METHODS: Murine keratinocyte (PAM212) and fibroblast (mKSA) cell lines were infected with cytotoxic S. aureus and cultured in the presence of various antibiotics at graded concentrations. The viability of host cells was measured 24 h after infection. To determine the bacterial viability within host cells, cellular lysates were prepared and colony forming units were quantified using a spiral plater. Host cells infected with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled S. aureus were analysed by flow cytometry and microscopy to determine the subcellular localization S. aureus. RESULTS: Oxacillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole did not rescue host cells from cell death induced by intracellular S. aureus. In contrast, linezolid, rifampicin, azithromycin, clindamycin, erythromycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin suppressed the cytotoxic action of S. aureus. After withdrawal of antibiotics, intracellular S. aureus regained cytotoxic activity and killed their host cells. Only rifampicin was able to eliminate intracellular S. aureus completely within 72 h. In contrast, clindamycin, azithromycin and linezolid induced a state of intracellular persistence of viable S. aureus. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotics commonly used for the management of S. aureus infections appear to create a niche for invasive intracellular S. aureus, which may play an important role for persistence and recurrence of infection. Because of its unique ability to eliminate intracellular S. aureus, rifampicin appears to be valuable for the treatment of invasive S. aureus infections. </text>

      <text>Full sequencing analysis of estrogen receptor-alpha gene polymorphism and its association with breast cancer risk. BACKGROUND: The estrogen receptor plays a critical role in breast cancer development and progression. So the genetic polymorphism of ER-alpha gene could affect cancer risk and phenotype. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We fully sequenced the ER-alpha gene to investigate its single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 100 breast cancer patients and 100 controls. RESULTS: Six novel polymorphism in the control and 11 in cancer patients were found. The G/G genotype at C975 G and A/A genotype at G1782 A had a protective effect against breast cancer when compared to other genotypes (OR = 0.3 and 0.3, respectively). 975G allele was associated inversely with the p53 expression and positively with the bcl-2 expression in cancer with borderline significance. Combining this result with our previous study, these associations became more significant (p = 0.005 and 0.019, respectively). CONCLUSION: Polymorphisms in ER-alpha gene can affect the breast cancer susceptibility and may be related to other protein expression, such as p53 and bcl-2. </text>

      <text>Effect of antitumor agents on cytotoxicity induction by sodium fluoride. We have recently found that sodium fluoride (NaF) induced apoptotic cell death in tumor cell lines. We investigated here whether 6 popular antitumor compounds modify the cytotoxic activity of NaF against human squamous cell carcinoma (HSC-2) and human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cell lines. Cytotoxic concentrations of cisplatin, etoposide, doxorubicin or peplomycin (tentatively termed as Group I compounds), but not methotrexate and 5-FU (tentatively termed as Group II compounds), enhanced the cytotoxic activity of NaF. NaF and Group I compounds induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in HL-60 cells, whereas Group II compounds were inactive even in the presence of NaF. Most Group I compounds except doxorubicin (which induced DNA fragmentation less effectively than others) activated caspase 3 more efficiently than Group II compounds. Caspase 8 (involved in non-mitochondrial extrinsic pathway) and caspase 9 (involved in mitochondrial intrinsic pathway) were also activated, but to a much lesser extent. NaF reduced the glucose consumption at early stage, possibly by inhibition of glycolysis, whereas cisplatin and etoposide reduced the glucose consumption at later stage, suggesting that early decline of glucose consumption is rather specific to NaF. </text>

      <text>Covariance structure analysis: statistical practice, theory, and directions. Although covariance structure analysis is used increasingly to analyze nonexperimental data, important statistical requirements for its proper use are frequently ignored. Valid conclusions about the adequacy of a model as an acceptable representation of data, which are based on goodness-of-fit test statistics and standard errors of parameter estimates, rely on the model estimation procedure being appropriate for the data. Using analogies to linear regression and anova, this review examines conditions under which conclusions drawn from various estimation methods will be correct and the consequences of ignoring these conditions. A distinction is made between estimation methods that are either correctly or incorrectly specified for the distribution of data being analyzed, and it is shown that valid conclusions are possible even under misspecification. A brief example illustrates the ideas. Internet access is given to a computer code for several methods that are not available in programs such as EQS or LISREL. </text>

      <text>The candidate tumour suppressor protein ING4 regulates brain tumour growth and angiogenesis. Gliomas are the most common primary tumours of the central nervous system, with nearly 15,000 diagnosed annually in the United States and a lethality approaching 80% within the first year of glioblastoma diagnosis. The marked induction of angiogenesis in glioblastomas suggests that it is a necessary part of malignant progression; however, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of brain tumour growth and angiogenesis remain unresolved. Here we report that a candidate tumour suppressor gene, ING4, is involved in regulating brain tumour growth and angiogenesis. Expression of ING4 is significantly reduced in gliomas as compared with normal human brain tissue, and the extent of reduction correlates with the progression from lower to higher grades of tumours. In mice, xenografts of human glioblastoma U87MG, which has decreased expression of ING4, grow significantly faster and have higher vascular volume fractions than control tumours. We show that ING4 physically interacts with p65 (RelA) subunit of nuclear factor NF-kappaB, and that ING4 regulates brain tumour angiogenesis through transcriptional repression of NF-kappaB-responsive genes. These results indicate that ING4 has an important role in brain tumour pathogenesis. </text>

      <text>TGFbeta1, back to the future: revisiting its role as a transforming growth factor. TGFbeta1 was initially identified in culture media from transformed cells as part of a factor that could produce a transformed phenotype in a nontransformed cell line. Subsequently this activity was separated into TGFbeta and TGFalpha an EGF receptor ligand. With the discovery that TGFbeta1 was a potent growth inhibitor of epithelial cells, and the identification of inactivating mutations within the TGFbeta1 signaling pathway in cancers it became clear that TGFbeta1 signaling is a tumor suppressor pathway for early stages of cancer. However many human carcinomas overexpress TGFbeta1 and this is associated with poor patient prognosis and increased frequency of metastasis. Similar results have been obtained with tumor cell lines and experimental animal models. Thus stage specific duality of function is the emerging paradigm for the role of TGFbeta1 in cancer. This review will focus on the evidence for TGFbeta1 as a tumor promoting and metastasis factor and examine the biological and molecular basis for these effects. It is proposed that the switch from tumor suppressor to oncogene reflects genetic or epigenetic alterations in signaling pathways in tumor cells that alter the readout from the TGFbeta1 pathway. </text>

      <text>Role of thrombin in angiogenesis and tumor progression. Clinical, laboratory, histopathological, and pharmacological evidence support the notion that the coagulation system, which is activated in most cancer patients, plays an important role in tumor biology. Our laboratory has provided evidence that thrombin activates angiogenesis, a process which is essential in tumor growth and metastasis. This event is independent of fibrin formation. At the cellular level many actions of thrombin can contribute to activation of angiogenesis: (1). Thrombin decreases the ability of endothelial cells to attach to basement membrane proteins. (2). Thrombin greatly potentiates vascular endothelial growth factor- (VEGF-) induced endothelial cell proliferation. This potentiation is accompanied by up-regulation of the expression of VEGF receptors (kinase insert domain-containing receptor [KDR] and fms-like tyrosine kinase [Flt-1]). (3). Thrombin increases the mRNA and protein levels of alpha (v)beta (3) integrin and serves as a ligand to this receptor. Furthermore, thrombin increases the secretion of VEGF and enhances the expression and protein synthesis of matrix metalloprotease-9 and alpha (v)beta (3) integrin in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells. These results could explain the angiogenic and tumor-promoting effect of thrombin and provide the basis for development of thrombin receptor mimetics or antagonists for therapeutic application. </text>

      <text>NIH3T3 transfectant containing human K-ras oncogene shows enhanced metastatic activity after in vivo tumor growth or co-culture with fibroblasts.  A clone of NIH3T3 transformant (H-3), obtained by transfecting genomic DNA of a human colon carcinoma cell line, contains human K-ras oncogene and yields metastatic pulmonary nodules after intravenous injection of the cells into nude mice. This metastatic ability was enhanced remarkably after in vivo tumor growth (subcutaneous tumor formation in nude mice) accompanied by increased mRNA expression and gene amplification of the human-derived K-ras oncogene, while it declined gradually as the passage number increased in vitro, with corresponding decreases of gene amplification and mRNA expression. Six subclones were randomly selected from H-3 cells which had been subcultured to passage 22. All of the clones in culture showed almost the same low level of metastatic ability and exhibited little K-ras oncogene amplification with correspondingly low mRNA expression. However, after they formed tumors in nude mice, every clone acquired high metastatic ability and the gene amplification increased, with elevated mRNA expression. These experimental facts indicated that acquisition of metastatic ability coupled with the function of K-ras oncogene was conditional in nature, being strongly affected by in vivo tumor circumstances. The low metastatic and G-418-resistant H-3 cells were co-cultured with BALB/c3T3 fibroblasts for 2-4 weeks. After removal of fibroblasts by exposure to G-418, the tumor cells exhibited increased metastatic ability and human K-ras oncogene mRNA, suggesting an intimate interaction between H-3 cells and fibroblasts influencing the function of transfected human K-ras oncogene. Fibroblasts of the host animal may thus have an important role in generating enhanced metastatic activity of H-3 cells. </text>

      <text>Potent antibacterial activity of Y-754, a novel benzimidazole compound with selective action against Helicobacter pylori. Y-754, a novel benzimidazole compound, was investigated for in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity. Unlike amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and metronidazole, the compound had no activity against common aerobic and anaerobic bacteria other than Helicobacter pylori. The minimum inhibitory concentration of Y-754 against H. pylori, at 0.025 microg/ml, was nearly equal to that of amoxicillin and clarithromycin. The respective concentrations of Y-754, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and metronidazole required to inhibit 90% of 39 isolates of H. pylori were 0.05, 0.39, 6.25, and 25 microg/ml, indicating the potent activity of Y-754, including activity against clarithromycin- and metronidazole-resistant strains. The anti-H. pylori activity of Y-754 was potent even at pH 5.5 and was bactericidal at concentrations of 0.1 microg/ml and above. Exposure of H. pylori to Y-754 did not result in the induction of drug-resistant mutation. Oral administration (10 mg/kg twice a day for 7 days) to Mongolian gerbils infected with strain ATCC 43504 demonstrated that Y-754 was effective in H. pylori eradication and that its eradication efficacy increased in line with the progress of damage to the gastric mucosa caused by H. pylori infection. Y-754 was also efficacious in the treatment of infection by the clarithromycin-resistant strain OIT-36. The results obtained lead to the expectation that the new benzimidazole Y-754 will, in the near future, be used for H. pylori eradication therapy in peptic ulcer patients. </text>

      <text>Active respiratory syncytial virus purified by ion-exchange chromatography: characterization of binding and elution requirements. Two viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) were used to evaluate viral purification by an affinity resin column (Matrex Cellufine Sulfate (MCS); Amicon Division, WR Grace &amp; Co.). Viable RSV was purified significantly from crude cell lysate by a single pass through a column containing the anionic MCS resin. Most cell protein and albumin eluted from the MCS resin with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) but RSV eluted at high ionic strength, i.e., greater than or equal to 0.6 M NaCl. Further purification was possible by sucrose step gradient centrifugation. The RSV prepared by column purification or by column plus sucrose gradient separation was both intact and infective. RSV and pure samples of VSV were used to optimize ionic strength and salts for elution from the MCS column: 0.8 M NaCl removed most of the viral protein. The capacity of the MCS gel for RSV or VSV was found to be about 0.6-0.8 mg viral protein per ml of hydrated resin. Detergent-solubilized viral membrane proteins bound to the MCS resin in 0.145 M NaCl and eluted with higher salt concentrations. Thus, this resin also may be a useful aid for relatively gentle purification of these proteins. </text>

      <text>Lactoferrin enhances Fas expression and apoptosis in the colon mucosa of azoxymethane-treated rats.  Bovine lactoferrin, a multifunctional glycoprotein, has been shown to strongly inhibit development of azoxymethane (AOM)-induced rat colon tumors. Little, however, is known about the inhibitory mechanisms. We have demonstrated recently that lactoferrin enhances the expression of a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, Fas, in the colon mucosa during both early and late stages of carcinogenesis. Thus, Fas could be involved in bovine lactoferrin-mediated inhibition of tumor development. To investigate this possibility, we studied the influence of bovine lactoferrin on Fas-mediated apoptosis with regard to expression of Fas, activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3, and DNA fragmentation in the colon mucosa of AOM-treated rats. Western blot analysis demonstrated a &gt;2.5-fold increase in Fas protein expression, as well as elevation of the active forms of both caspase-8 and caspase-3. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed Fas-positive cells and apoptotic cells preferentially within the proximal colon region, clearly at the site of bovine lactoferrin-mediated tumor inhibition. These results suggest that apoptosis caused by elevated expression of Fas is involved in chemoprevention by lactoferrin of colon carcinogenesis. </text>

      <text>Dynein light chain 1, a p21-activated kinase 1-interacting substrate, promotes cancerous phenotypes.  We identified dynein light chain 1 (DLC1) as a physiologic substrate of p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1). Pak1-DLC1 interaction plays an essential role in cell survival, which depends on Pak1's phosphorylation of DLC1 on Ser88. Pak1 associates with the complex of DLC1 and BimL, a proapoptotic BH3-only protein, and phosphorylates both proteins. Phosphorylation of BimL by Pak1 prevents it from interacting with and inactivation of Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic protein. Overexpression of DLC1 but not DLC1-Ser88Ala mutant promotes cancerous properties of breast cancer cells. DLC1 protein level is elevated in more than 90% of human breast tumors. The regulation of cell survival functions by Pak1-DLC1 interaction represents a novel mechanism by which a signaling kinase might regulate the cancerous phenotypes. </text>

      <text>Novel insights into the pathogenesis of uric acid nephrolithiasis. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The factors involved in the pathogenesis of uric acid nephrolithiasis are well known. A low urinary pH is the most significant element in the generation of stones, with hyperuricosuria being a less common finding. The underlying mechanism(s) responsible for these disturbances remain poorly characterized. This review summarizes previous knowledge and highlights some recent developments in the pathophysiology of low urine pH and hyperuricosuria. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological and metabolic studies have indicated an association between uric acid nephrolithiasis and insulin resistance. Some potential mechanisms include impaired ammoniagenesis caused by resistance to insulin action in the renal proximal tubule, or substrate competition by free fatty acids. The evaluation of a large Sicilian kindred recently revealed a putative genetic locus linked to uric acid stone disease. The identification of novel complementary DNA has provided an interesting insight into the renal handling of uric acid, including one genetic cause of renal uric acid wasting. SUMMARY: The recognition of metabolic, molecular, and genetic factors that influence urinary pH, and uric acid metabolism and excretion, will provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of uric acid stones, and open the way for new therapeutic strategies. </text>

      <text>Multicriteria evaluation of simulated logging scenarios in a tropical rain forest. Forest growth models are useful tools for investigating the long-term impacts of logging. In this paper, the results of the rain forest growth model FORMIND were assessed by a multicriteria decision analysis. The main processes covered by FORMIND include tree growth, mortality, regeneration and competition. Tree growth is calculated based on a carbon balance approach. Trees compete for light and space; dying large trees fall down and create gaps in the forest. Sixty-four different logging scenarios for an initially undisturbed forest stand at Deramakot (Malaysia) were simulated. The scenarios differ regarding the logging cycle, logging method, cutting limit and logging intensity. We characterise the impacts with four criteria describing the yield, canopy opening and changes in species composition. Multicriteria decision analysis was used for the first time to evaluate the scenarios and identify the efficient ones. Our results plainly show that reduced-impact logging scenarios are more 'efficient' than the others, since in these scenarios forest damage is minimised without significantly reducing yield. Nevertheless, there is a trade-off between yield and achieving a desired ecological state of logged forest; the ecological state of the logged forests can only be improved by reducing yields and enlarging the logging cycles. Our study also demonstrates that high cutting limits or low logging intensities cannot compensate for the high level of damage caused by conventional logging techniques. </text>

      <text>Matrix metalloproteinase activity and immunohistochemical profile of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 during human dermal wound healing. Proteolytic activity is required for the turnover of the extracellular matrix during wound healing. Matrix metalloproteinases can collectively cleave all components of the extracellular matrix, with the endogenous tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 regulating their activity. Breast tissue taken at varying postoperative times (n= 92) or during surgery (controls, n= 17), was used to investigate the temporal and spatial activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 during human wound healing. Matrix metalloproteinase activity, determined using a quenched fluorescence substrate assay, increased during early healing (3-8 weeks) compared to controls, and then decreased between 24 and 36 weeks after surgery (p  less than  0.05 until 24 weeks, Mann-Whitney U-test). Immunohistochemistry scores for matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression were significantly elevated compared to controls in scar endothelial cells and fibroblasts from 2 until 12 and 20 weeks, respectively. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 staining was observed exclusively in fibroblasts, reaching maximum levels 8-12 weeks after surgery, decreasing by 1.5 years but remaining significantly increased. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 staining was relatively sparse but was significantly increased until 8 weeks after surgery. These results show that matrix metalloproteinases are present at elevated levels during early wound healing, when angiogenesis occurs, and suggest that matrix metalloproteinase-9 may play a significant role. The later expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 in fibroblasts suggests a role in extracellular matrix remodeling. </text>

      <text>Convergence of p53 and TGF-beta signaling networks.  p53 is a protein with many talents. One of the most fundamental is the ability to act as essential growth checkpoint that protects cells against cellular transformation. p53 does so through the induction of genes leading to growth arrest or apoptosis. Most of the studies focusing on the mechanisms of p53 activity have been performed in cultured cells upon treatment with well-established p53-activating inputs, such as high doses of radiations, DNA-damaging drugs and activated oncogenes. However, how the tumor suppressive functions of p53 become concerted with the extracellular cues arriving at the cell surface during tissue homeostasis, remains largely unknown. Intriguingly, two recent papers have shed new light into this unexplored field, indicating that p53 plays a key role in TGF-beta-induced growth arrest and, unexpectedly, in the developmental effects of TGF-beta in early embryos. Here we review and comment on these findings and on their implications for cancer biology. </text>

      <text>Enhanced IGF-1 expression improves smooth muscle cell engraftment after cell transplantation. The functional benefit of cell transplantation after a myocardial infarction is diminished by early cell losses. IGF-1 enhances cell proliferation and survival. We hypothesized that IGF-1-transfected smooth muscle cells (SMCs) would enhance cell survival and improve engraftment after cell transplantation. The IGF-1 gene was transfected into male SMCs and compared with SMCs transfected with a plasmid vector (vector control) and nontransfected SMCs (cell control). IGF-1 mRNA (n=10/group) and protein levels (n=6/group) were higher (P  less than 0.05 for all groups) at 3, 7, and 14 days compared with controls. VEGF was also increased in parallel to enhanced IGF-1 expression. IGF-1-transfected cells demonstrated greater cell proliferation, stimulated angiogenesis, and decreased caspase-3 activity after simulated ischemia and reperfusion (P  less than 0.05 for all groups compared with vector or cell controls). A uniform left ventricular injury was produced in female rats using a cryoprobe. Three weeks later, 2 x 10(6) cells from three groups were implanted into the scar. One week later, IGF-1-transfected SMCs had increased myocardial IGF-1 and VEGF levels, increased Bcl2 expression, limited cell apoptosis, and enhanced vessel formation in the myocardial scar compared with the two control groups (P  less than 0.05 for all groups). The proportion of SMCs surviving in the implanted region was greater (P  less than 0.05) in the IGF-1-transfected group than in the vector or cell controls. Gene enhancement with IGF-1 improved donor cell proliferation, survival, and engraftment after cell transplantation, perhaps mediated by enhanced angiogenesis and reduced apoptosis. </text>

      <text>[Altered expression of PTEN gene and LOH of its epigenetic microsatellite in gastric carcinoma].  OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of PTEN and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of its epigenetic microsatellite in gastric carcinoma and explore their roles in progression of gastric carcinoma. METHODS: LOH of epigenetic microsatellites of PTEN (D10S541, D10S583 and D10S1687) in advanced gastric cancer was detected by PCR-SSCP. Expression of PTEN mRNA and protein in normal gastric mucosa and gastric cancer was evaluated by RT-PCR and SABC immunohistochemistry, respectively. The relationship between expression of PTEN mRNA and protein and lymph node metastasis or LOH of microsatellites was discussed. RESULTS: LOH of D10S541, D10S583 and D10S1687 was found in 37.5% (21/56) of advanced gastric cancers. The positive rates of PTEN mRNA expression were 80.4% (45/56), 45.5% (5/11) and 32.1% (18/56) in normal mucosa, early and advanced gastric carcinomas, respectively, while 78.6% (44/56), 44.5% (5/11) and 28.6% (16/56) at the protein level. PTEN mRNA and protein were less frequently expressed in early and advanced gastric carcinomas than that in normal gastric mucosa (P &lt; 0.05). There was positive correlation between PTEN mRNA expression and LOH of microsatellites in advanced gastric carcinomas. PTEN protein expression paralleled with its mRNA expression (P &lt; 0.05). The expression of PTEN mRNA and protein was negatively correlated with lymph node metastasis of advanced gastric carcinomas (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Down-regulated expression of PTEN gene is found in different stages of gastric carcinoma, and is closely correlated with LOH of its epigenetic microsatellites, which probably is its underlying molecular mechanisms. It suggests that altered PTEN gene contributes to tumorigenesis and progression of gastric carcinomas. </text>

      <text>Flow dynamics of the internal thoracic and radial artery T-graft. BACKGROUND: Complex use of arterial conduits has resurrected concerns about the adequacy of conduit flow. The T-graft is the extreme example of this trend. Our purpose was to identify the limitation of single source inflow and to compare flow capacity with completion coronary flow. METHODS: Between February 1999 and November 2001, 372 patients underwent total arterial revascularization with the T-graft alone. Intraoperative flows were recorded for each limb of the T-graft before and after distal anastomoses in 204 patients. Independent predictors of T-graft flow were identified by multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Free flow for the radial arterial (RA) limb was 161 +/- 81 mL/min, the internal thoracic artery (ITA) limb 137 +/- 57 mL/min (combined 298 +/- 101 mL/min) versus simultaneous limb flow of 226 +/- 84 mL/min giving a flow restriction of 24% +/- 14%. Completion coronary flow was 88 +/- 49 mL/min for the RA, 60 +/- 45 mL/min for the ITA, and 140 +/- 70 mL/min for both limbs simultaneously to give a flow reserve (vs simultaneous free flow) of 160% or 1.6. Independent predictors of completion RA limb flow are RA proximal diameter (p = 0.005), number of anastomoses (p = 0.018), and target stenosis (p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: A flow reserve of 1.6 compares favorably with an ITA flow reserve of 1.8 at 1-month postoperatively and 1.8 for both the ITA T-graft and the ITA/RA T-graft at 1-week postoperatively as reported by others. Proximal RA diameter and competitive coronary flow influence completion T-graft flow. These data quantitate the limitation of single source inflow of the T-graft configuration and support its continued use. </text>

      <text>[Glaucoma and ocular ischemic syndrome--case report] PURPOSE: Ocular ischemic syndrome (OIS) is often poorly diagnosed and treated as primary open angle glaucoma or later on, as neovascular glaucoma. We present a 54 year old male, treated topical since 23 years for glaucoma and sent to our clinic for trabeculectomy because of rapid worsening of vision on right eye with bilateral total excavation of optic disc. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational case report. RESULTS: Because of typical signs of IOS (iris neovascularization, mid-peripheral dot and blot hemorrhages in both eyes, narrowed arterioles in right eye, following examinations were performed: Doppler ultrasonography of carotid arteries, digital subtractional angiography of the carotid vessels and magnetic resonance angiography. The examinations showed occlusion of the right common carotid artery and with 80% stenosis of the left common carotid artery, occlusion of abdominal aorta. After phacoemulsification with implantation of intraocular lens because of rapid intumescence cataract in the right eye, and endarterectomy of left external carotid artery, the neovascularization of the iris regressed in both eyes. CONCLUSION: In case of iris neovascularization or mid-peripheral hemorrhages the Doppler sonography of carotid arteries should be performed. Quick cooperation between ophthalmologist, radiologist and vascular surgeon following endarterectomy seems to stop progressing changes of ocular ischemic syndrome. </text>

      <text>Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-3 enhance the incorporation of cytosine arabinoside into the DNA of leukemic blasts and the cytotoxic effect on clonogenic cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia.  In the present study the effects of the 48-hour administration of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (100 U/mL) or interleukin-3 (IL-3) (100 U/mL) on the proliferative activity of leukemic cells and on the intracellular metabolism and cytotoxic efficacy of a subsequent 12-hour application of cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) at doses of 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, and 100.0 mumol/L were evaluated on bone marrow cells from 17 patients with acute myeloid leukemia. After GM-CSF or IL-3, a 1.2- to 2.4-fold increase in S-phase cells was observed in nine of 14 GM-CSF and seven of 11 IL-3 cases. 3H-Cytosine arabinoside incorporation into the DNA was enhanced 1.33- to 18.3-fold over respective controls in 14 of 17 patients. While in control specimens are ara-C dose-dependent increase in 3H-ara-C uptake was accompanied by a corresponding rise in intracellular ara-C-5' triphosphate (ara-CTP) levels, ara-CTP concentrations were not increased after GM-CSF or IL-3 exposure, resulting in a higher ara-C to ara-CTP ratio over controls. This finding may be explained by a stimulatory effect of GM-CSF and IL-3 on ara-C phosphorylating enzymes and a more rapid incorporation of ara-CTP into the DNA of leukemic blasts. These effects translated into a 2.2- to 229.0-fold increase in the cytotoxic activity of ara-C against clonogenic leukemic cells after GM-CSF or IL-3 pretreatment. Hence, GM-CSF and IL-3 enhance the intracellular metabolism of ara-C and its incorporation into the DNA of leukemic cells leading to a higher antileukemic activity of ara-C on clonogenic leukemic cells (CFU-L). </text>

      <text>Human cytomegalovirus 5-kilobase immediate-early RNA is a stable intron. Immediate-early viral gene products of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) are derived from several genomic loci and largely serve to establish a cellular environment conducive to viral replication. We have further examined an unusual immediate-early transcript known as the 5-kb RNA, concluding that it is a stable intron encoded by HCMV. The 5-kb RNA is highly AT rich in sequence and lacks open reading frames likely to be translated into protein. We confirmed the absence of polyadenylation of the transcript and showed that it is primarily nuclear localized during viral infection. We mapped the 5' end of the 5-kb RNA to a consensus splice donor site and localized the 3' end in the vicinity of a splice acceptor site. In transfection studies, we showed that the 5-kb RNA can be spliced from a heterologous primary transcript. Using bacterial artificial chromosome technology, we constructed a viral recombinant containing a mutation in the 5' splice donor site that defines the 5' end of the RNA and found that this mutation eliminates expression of the 5-kb RNA during viral infection. This mutant grows in human fibroblasts without complementation. Taken together, these data support the conclusion that the 5-kb RNA is a stable intron expressed by HCMV. </text>

      <text>Silencing of monocarboxylate transporters via small interfering ribonucleic acid inhibits glycolysis and induces cell death in malignant glioma: an in vitro study.  OBJECTIVE: Dependence on glycolysis is a hallmark of malignant tumors. As a consequence, these tumors generate more lactate, which is effluxed from cells by monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). We hypothesized that 1) MCT expression in malignant tumors may differ from normal tissue in quantity, isoform, or both; and 2) silencing MCT expression would induce intracellular acidification, resulting in decreased proliferation and/or increased cell death. METHODS: We quantified expression of MCT isoforms in human glioblastoma multiforme and glioma-derived cells lines by Western blot analysis. MCTs that were abundant or specific to glioma then were targeted in the model U-87 MG glioma cell line via small interfering ribonucleic acid-mediated gene silencing and tested for inhibition of lactate efflux, intracellular pH changes, reduced proliferation, and/or induction of cell death. RESULTS: MCT 1 and 2 were the primary isoforms expressed in human glioblastoma multiforme and glioma-derived cell lines. In contrast, MCT 3 was the predominantly expressed isoform in normal brain. Small interfering ribonucleic acid specific for MCT 1 and 2 reduced expression of these isoforms in U-87 MG cells to barely detectable levels and reduced lactate efflux by 30% individually and 85% in combination, with a concomitant decrease of intracellular pH by 0.6 units (a fourfold increase in intracellular H(+)). Prolonged silencing of both MCTs reduced viability by 75% individually and 92% in combination, as measured by both phenotypic and flow cytometric analyses. CONCLUSION: MCT targeting significantly reduced the viability of U-87 MG cells mediated by both apoptosis and necrosis. This indicates that the strategy may be a useful therapeutic avenue for treatment of patients with malignant glioma. </text>

      <text>Hypoxia-responsive element-mediated soluble Tie2 vector exhibits an anti-angiogenic activity in vitro under hypoxic condition. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is one of the key mammalian transcription factors and shows increased levels in both protein stability and intrinsic transcriptional activity during low oxygen tension. Hypoxia-activated functional HIF-1 protein binds to hypoxia-responsive elements (HRE) in the enhancers of several genes including VEGF, the major player in angiogenesis, and initiates their mRNA expression. The molecular mechanisms regulating the gene expression under hypoxic conditions could increase the therapeutic window of tumor-specific delivery systems. In this study, to examine hypoxia-specific production of anti-angiogenic therapeutic gene, we constructed 5 copies of HRE (5xHRE) of human VEGF linked to soluble Tie2 (sTie2) driven by minimal SV40 promoter (5xHRE/SV40/sTie2). Our data showed that under hypoxia the secreted sTie2 selectively inhibited tube formation and migration capacities of endothelial cells in vitro. Hence, we propose that the vector system, 5xHRE/SV40/sTie2, might be a useful tool for down-regulating tumor angiogenesis under hypoxic condition. </text>

      <text>Proteome analysis of NIH3T3 cells transformed by activated Galpha12: regulation of leukemia-associated protein SET.  Galpha(12), the alpha-subunit of the G12 family of heterotrimeric G proteins is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and neoplastic transformation. GTPase-deficient, constitutively activated mutant of Galpha(12) (Galpha(12)Q229L or Galpha(12)QL) has been previously shown to induce oncogenic transformation of NIH3T3 cells promoting serum- and anchorage-independent growth. Reduced growth-factor dependent, autonomous cell growth forms a critical defining point at which a normal cell turns into an oncogenic one. To identify the underlying mechanism involved in such growth-factor/serum independent growth of Galpha(12)QL-transformed NIH3T3, we carried out a two-dimensional differential proteome analysis of Galpha(12)QL-transformed NIH3T3 cells and cells expressing vector control. This analysis revealed a total of 22 protein-spots whose expression was altered by more than 3-folds. Two of these spots were identified by MALDI-MS analysis as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and myeloid-leukemia-associated SET protein. The increased expressions of these proteins in Galpha(12)QL cells were validated by immunoblot analysis. Furthermore, transient transfection studies with NIH3T3 cells indicated that the expression of activated Galpha(12) readily increased the expression of SET protein by 24 h. As SET has been previously reported to be an inhibitor of phosphatase PP2A, the nuclear phosphatase activity was monitored in cells expressing activated Galpha(12). Our results indicate that the nuclear phosphatase activity is inhibited by greater than 50% in Galpha(12)QL cells compared to vector control cells. Thus, our results from differential proteome analysis presented here report for the first time a role for SET in Galpha(12)-mediated signaling pathways and a role for Galpha(12) in the regulation of the leukemia-associated SET-protein expression. </text>

      <text>Matrix metalloproteinase/tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase phenotype identifies poor prognosis colorectal cancers.  PURPOSE: The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of proteolytic enzymes involved in tumor invasion; several individual members of which have been implicated in tumor prognosis. These enzymes and their physiologic inhibitors, the tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs), act in a coordinated manner to form an integrated system. Therefore, to understand their role in tumor invasion, it is necessary to evaluate them collectively. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study all of the major members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, MMP-9, MMP-13, MT1-MMP and MT2-MMP)/tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP-1, TIMP-2, and TIMP-3) system have been investigated by immunohistochemistry in a series (n = 90) of stage III (Dukes' C) colorectal cancers. An immunohistochemical score based on the intensity of immunoreactivity and proportion of immunoreactive cells was established for each MMP and TIMP. RESULTS: The MMP/TIMP profile defined by hierarchical cluster analysis of the immunohistochemical score identifies a distinct group of colorectal cancers with poor prognosis (log-rank test, 12.22, P = 0.0005). The median survival time of patients in this survival group was 18 months compared with a median survival of 49 months in the "good" survival group. Multivariate analysis showed that this profile was independently the most significant prognostic factor (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified that the MMP/TIMP profile is an independent indicator of poor prognosis in colorectal cancer. </text>

      <text>2-methoxyestradiol inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha, tumor growth, and angiogenesis and augments paclitaxel efficacy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. PURPOSE: Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas have been reported to overexpress hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, a transcription factor that promotes expression of angiogenesis factors and resistance to programmed and therapy-induced cell death. 2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2) is a natural compound with HIF-1alpha inhibitory activity that is currently being evaluated in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials for advanced solid tumors and multiple myeloma. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the effects of 2ME2 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In the present study, we investigated the effects of 2ME2 alone and in combination with paclitaxel, an active agent in recurrent or advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. RESULTS: 2ME2 exhibited antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects in a panel of five head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines in the 0.5 to 10 micromol/L range, including induction of G2-M blockade, caspase-3/7 activation, and apoptosis at 48 hours. 2ME2 resulted in decreased nuclear HIF-1alpha-binding activity and affected the expression of downstream genes, such as bid, a proapoptotic bcl-2 family member, and vascular endothelial growth factor, a proangiogenic cytokine. The up-regulation of Bid (57.5% at 12 hours, P  less than  0.0006) and inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor secretion (57.7% at 24 hours, P  less than  0.015; and 50.3% at 48 hours, P  less than  0.0006) could be partially attributed to the effects on HIF-1alpha, because HIF-1alpha small interfering RNAs produced similar effects. Finally, in vivo, in a xenograft model of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma using UM-SCC-11A cells, 2ME2 exhibited antitumor and antiangiogenic activity, as measured by CD31 immunostaining. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide support for the use of 2ME2 in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of recurrent or advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. </text>

      <text>HIF-2alpha expression in human fetal paraganglia and neuroblastoma: relation to sympathetic differentiation, glucose deficiency, and hypoxia. Solid tumors are frequently necrotic and hypoxic due to poor vascularization. Tumor cells adapt to hypoxia by modulating their phenotype. Key players in this process are the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-1alpha to 3alpha). HIFs are also expressed during normal development; for example, HIF-2alpha is specifically expressed and appears to be involved in the development of the murine sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Here, we demonstrate that HIF-2alpha protein is selectively present in human fetal week 8.5 SNS paraganglia. Neuroblastoma is derived from SNS precursors. In a subset of neuroblastomas, a spontaneous neuronal to neuroendocrine differentiation occurs in areas adjacent to necrotic zones. As HIF-2alpha activity has been associated not only with hypoxic but also with hypoglycemic conditions, we have investigated putative effects of hypoxia, glucose depletion, and HIF-2alpha on the neuroblastoma phenotype. HIF-2alpha was detected in hypoxic and in well-oxygenized neuroblastoma cells and tissue, presumably reflecting their embryonic features. With regard to differentiation, hypoxic cells lost their neuronal/neuroendocrine features and gained marker gene expression associated with an immature, neural crest-like phenotype. Low glucose potentiated the effect of hypoxia. These findings suggest that poorly vascularized neuroblastomas become immature and maintain a more aggressive phenotype, which possibly could involve a sustained stabilization and activation of HIF-2alpha. </text>

      <text>Reduced prognostic power of ventricular late potentials in post-infarction patients of the reperfusion era. AIMS: To test the prognostic value of ventricular late potentials (LPs) in a large cohort of post-infarction patients in the modern reperfusion era. METHODS AND RESULTS: 1800 consecutive survivors of acute myocardial infarction in sinus rhythm and under 76 years of age were enrolled. Many (99%) of the patients received reperfusion/revascularization therapy (91% percutaneous coronary intervention) and up-to-date pharmacological treatment (99% aspirin, 93% beta-blockers, 90% ACE-inhibitors, and 85% statins). LPs were calculated in 968 patients and found to be present in 90 (9.3%). The primary endpoint was the composite of cardiac death and serious arrhythmic events. The secondary endpoint was the composite of sudden cardiac death and serious arrhythmic events. During follow-up (median 34 months), 26 patients reached the primary endpoint. The presence of LPs was not significantly associated with the primary endpoint in univariable or multivariable analysis. In contrast, low (&lt; or = 30%) left ventricular ejection fraction (hazard ratio 9.6, 95% confidence interval 4.1-22.4), heart rate turbulence category 2 (7.5, 2.4-23.9) and category 1 (5.3, 1.9-14.9) were significant predictors in both univariable and multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION: Ventricular LPs are of limited use for risk stratification in unselected post-infarction patients in the modern reperfusion era. </text>

      <text>Expression and purification of the catalytic domain of human vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 for inhibitor screening. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an endothelial cell-specific mitogen, can act in tumor-induced angiogenesis by binding to specific receptors on the surface of endothelial cells. One such receptor, VEGFR-2/KDR, plays a key role in VEGF-induced angiogenesis. Here, we expressed the catalytic domain of VEGFR-2 as a soluble active kinase using Bac-to-Bac expression system, and investigated correlations between VEGFR-2 activity and enzyme concentration, ATP concentration, substrate concentration and divalent cation type. We used these data to establish a convenient, effective and non-radioactive ELISA screening technique for the identification and evaluation of potential inhibitors for VEGFR-2 kinase. We screened 200 RTK target-based compounds and identified one (TKI-31) that potently inhibited VEGFR-2 kinase activity (IC50=0.596 microM). Treatment of NIH3T3/KDR cells with TKI-31 blocked VEGF-induced phosphorylation of KDR in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, TKI-31 dose-dependently suppressed HUVEC tube formation. Thus, we herein report a novel, efficient method for identifying VEGFR-2 kinase inhibitors and introduce one, TKI-31, that may prove to be a useful new angiogenesis inhibitor. </text>

      <text>Novel biological agents for the treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). Hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) is an inevitable evolution of prostate carcinogenesis, through which the normal dependence on hormones for growth and survival is bypassed. Although advances in terms of symptoms palliation and quality of life improvement have been addressed with current treatment options, innovative approaches are needed to improve survival rates. A thorough understanding of HRPC-associated molecular pathways and mechanisms of resistance are a prerequisite for novel potential therapeutic interventions. Preclinical and early clinical studies are ongoing to evaluate new therapies that target specific molecular entities. Agents under development include growth factor receptor inhibitors, small molecules targeting signal transduction pathways, apoptosis and cell-cycle regulators, angiogenesis and metastasis inhibitors, differentiation agents, telomerase inactivators, and epigenetic therapeutics. Incorporation of these agents into existing treatment regimens will guide us in the development of a multidisciplinary treatment strategy of HRPC. This article critically reviews published data on new biological agents that are being tested in HRPC clinical trials, highlights ongoing research and considers the future perspectives of this new class of agents. </text>

      <text>Role of thrombogenic factors in the development of atherosclerosis. Hemostatic factors play a crucial role in generating thrombotic plugs at sites of vascular damage (atherothrombosis). However, whether hemostatic factors contribute directly or indirectly to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis remains uncertain. Autopsy studies have revealed that intimal thickening represents the first stage of atherosclerosis and that lipid-rich plaque arises from such lesions. Several factors contribute to the start of intimal thickening. Platelets release several growth factors and bioactive agents that play a central role in development of not only thrombus but also of intimal thickening. We have been investigating which coagulation factors simultaneously, or subsequently with platelet aggregation, participate in thrombus formation. Tissue factor (TF) is an essential initiator of blood coagulation that is expressed in various stages of atherosclerotic lesions in humans and other animals. Factors including thrombin and fibrin, which are downstream of the coagulation cascade activated by TF, also contribute to atherosclerosis. TF is involved in cell migration, embryogenesis and angiogenesis. Thus TF, in addition to factors downstream of the coagulation cascade and the protease-activated receptor 2 activation system, would be a multifactorial regulator of atherogenesis. </text>

      <text>Angiogenin is up-regulated in the nucleus and cytoplasm in human primary breast carcinoma and is associated with markers of hypoxia but not survival.  Angiogenin, a 14.2 kD polypeptide that was originally noted for its angiogenic activity, is now increasingly recognized to have a multiplicity of biological roles in both physiological and pathological conditions. In breast cancer, there are conflicting studies questioning the role of angiogenin. Here, the pattern of expression of angiogenin during the transition from normal breast tissue to ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma is reported together with the correlates between the level of angiogenin in 239 invasive carcinomas and standard clinicopathological parameters, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha and the HIF-1 alpha target gene DEC-1. This study shows that angiogenin expression is up-regulated in the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments in in situ carcinoma and invasive carcinoma compared with normal breast tissue and that angiogenin expression in invasive carcinomas is significantly positively associated with high tumour grade (p = 0.03), positive oestrogen receptor (ER) status (p = 0.01), HIF-1 alpha (p = 0.001) and DEC 1 (p = 0.001), but not with patient age (p = 0.8), tumour size (p = 0.25), lymph node status (p = 0.69), epidermal growth factor receptor (p = 0.56) or microvessel density (p = 0.32). No difference in relapse-free (p = 0.26) or overall (p = 0.63) survival was observed in patients stratified by angiogenin expression. This study suggests that angiogenin may be important in breast cancer progression and that, through its relationship with ER, it may be a target for tamoxifen. </text>

      <text>Hereditary paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma and inherited succinate dehydrogenase deficiency.  Mitochondrial complex II, or succinate dehydrogenase, is a key enzymatic complex involved in both the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation as part of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Germline succinate dehydrogenase subunit A (SDHA) mutations have been reported in a few patients with a classical mitochondrial neurodegenerative disease. Mutations in the genes encoding the three other succinate dehydrogenase subunits (SDHB, SDHC and SDHD) have been identified in patients affected by familial or 'apparently sporadic' paraganglioma and/or pheochromocytoma, an autosomal inherited cancer-susceptibility syndrome. These discoveries have dramatically changed the work-up and genetic counseling of patients and families with paragangliomas and/or pheochromocytomas. The subsequent identification of germline mutations in the gene encoding fumarase--another TCA cycle enzyme--in a new hereditary form of susceptibility to renal, uterine and cutaneous tumors has highlighted the potential role of the TCA cycle and, more generally, of the mitochondria in cancer. </text>

      <text>[Uncommon etiology of gastrointestinal bleeding: duodenal metastases from renal cell carcinoma]. Because of its unpredictable behavior, renal cell carcinoma is one of the most controversial neoplasms. On the one hand, patients frequently show metastases at diagnosis because of its slight manifestations, while on the other, the neoplasm can remain stable after nephrectomy and can then metastasize many years later. When this happens, the metastases usually involve more than 2 organs. The most frequent sites of metastases are the lung and lymph nodes, followed by the bones and liver, while duodenal involvement is rare. Indeed, intestinal metastases are found in only 2% of autopsies and of these, renal cell carcinoma metastases account for 7.1%. We present a case of a solitary late recurrence presenting as upper gastrointestinal bleeding 19 years after nephrectomy for clear cell renal carcinoma. </text>

      <text>Mouse p10, an alternative spliced form of p15INK4b, inhibits cell cycle progression and malignant transformation.  The INK4 family of proteins negatively regulates cell cycle progression at the G(1)-S transition by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases. Two of these cell cycle inhibitors, p16(INK4A) and p15(INK4B), have tumor suppressor activities and are inactivated in human cancer. Interestingly, both INK4 genes express alternative splicing variants. In addition to p16(INK4A), the INK4A locus encodes a splice variant, termed p12--specifically expressed in human pancreas--and ARF, a protein encoded by an alternative reading frame that acts as a tumor suppressor through the p53 pathway. Similarly, the human INK4B locus encodes the p15(INK4B) tumor suppressor and one alternatively spliced form, termed as p10. We show here that p10, which arises from the use of an alternative splice donor site within intron 1, is conserved in the mouse genome and is widely expressed in mouse tissues. Similarly to mouse p15(INK4B), p10 expression is also induced by oncogenic insults and transforming growth factor-beta treatment and acts as a cell cycle inhibitor. Importantly, we show that mouse p10 is able to induce cell cycle arrest in a p53-dependent manner. We also show that mouse p10 is able to inhibit foci formation and anchorage-independent growth in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and that these antitransforming properties of mouse p10 are also p53-dependent. These results indicate that the INK4B locus, similarly to INK4A-ARF, harbors two different splicing variants that can be involved in the regulation of both the p53 and retinoblastoma pathways, the two major molecular pathways in tumor suppression. </text>

      <text>Rofecoxib as adjunctive therapy for haemophilic arthropathy. Joint haemorrhage and subsequent haemophilic arthropathy are significant complications in haemophilia. The pathophysiology involves inflammation and angiogenesis. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors are anti-inflammatory agents, which have potent anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic and analgesic properties yet do not affect platelet function in the manner of traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These properties make such agents potentially useful as adjunctive therapy in haemophilia. There is only one prior report describing rofecoxib treatment in a single haemophilia patient. Our objectives were to determine the safety and efficacy of rofecoxib in treating acute haemarthrosis, chronic synovitis, target joints and pain. We conducted a retrospective medical record review of patients treated with rofecoxib for acute haemarthrosis, chronic synovitis, target joint or pain. The safety and efficacy of rofecoxib treatment were determined based on subjective patient reports and physical examinations during follow-up clinic visits. A total of 28 patients between 3 and 37 years of age were treated for a total of 42 courses of rofecoxib treatment. All courses were evaluated for safety and 31 for efficacy. Rofecoxib was used for eight acute haemarthrosis, four target joints, seven cases of synovitis and 12 episodes of pain. Efficacy was demonstrated particularly for chronic synovitis and pain and no serious adverse events occurred. This is the largest study to date evaluating COX-2 inhibitors as adjunctive therapy in haemophilia and suggests that these agents may be an important adjunctive therapy in the management of haemophilia. </text>

      <text>Bcl-2 decreases cell proliferation and promotes accumulation of cells in S phase without affecting the rate of apoptosis in human ovarian carcinoma cells. OBJECTIVES: The Bcl-2 protein is an important regulator of the apoptotic cascade and promotes cell survival. Bcl-2 can also delay entry into the cell cycle from quiescence. In the present study, we used two isogenic human ovarian carcinoma cell lines, which expressed differential levels of Bcl-2 proteins, to demonstrate that Bcl-2 may regulate the growth rates of adenocarcinoma cells. METHODS: The growth rates of two isogenic ovarian cancer cell lines were determined by XTT assays and flow cytometry combined with PI staining. Bcl-2-overexpressing SKOV3 cells were modified to express a doxycycline-inducible anti-Bcl-2 single-chain antibody and the effects of Bcl-2 protein inhibition on cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed. RESULTS: We demonstrate that Bcl-2 promotes the accumulation of proliferating carcinoma cells in S phase. The Bcl-2-overexpressing SKOV3 cell line proliferates markedly faster and shows delayed progression to G2M phase compared to its low Bcl-2-expressing counterpart SKOV3.ip1 cell line. Single-chain antibody-mediated inhibition of Bcl-2 in SKOV3 cells was associated with increased growth rates and more rapid cell cycle progression. Treatment with cisplatin resulted in more cells accumulating in S phase in Bcl-2-overexpressing SKOV3 cells, while the inhibition of Bcl-2 abolished delayed entry into G2M phase without affecting cisplatin-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that, in ovarian cancer cells, Bcl-2 delays cell cycle progression by promoting accumulation of cells in S phase without affecting the rate of apoptosis. Thus, in addition to its known role at the G0/G1 checkpoint, we demonstrate for the first time that Bcl-2 also regulates the S phase. </text>

      <text>Thalidomide and angiostatin inhibit tumor growth in a murine xenograft model of human cervical cancer. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of thalidomide and angiostatin on tumor growth, angiogenesis, and apoptosis in a xenograft model of cervical cancer. METHODS: Human umbilical endothelial cells were treated with angiostatin or thalidomide and bFGF-induced proliferation was assessed with the MTT assay. Human cervical cancer cells (CaSki and SiHa) were injected into the flanks of nude mice. After tumors developed, mice were treated with angiostatin 20 mg/kg/day or thalidomide 200 mg/kg/day for 30 days. Fractional tumor growth was determined and immunohistochemical analysis of tumors was used to determine degree of angiogenesis. TUNEL assay was used to assess apoptosis. RESULTS: Angiostatin inhibited endothelial cell proliferation by 50-60%. Thalidomide had no direct effect on endothelial cells. Angiostatin and thalidomide both inhibited tumor growth by about 55%. We found no additive or synergistic effect when the two agents were combined. Both agents inhibited angiogenesis and induced apoptosis when compared to tumors from control animals. CONCLUSIONS: Angiostatin and thalidomide inhibit tumor growth, angiogenesis, and induce apoptosis in this xenograft model of cervical cancer. </text>

      <text>Therapeutic Electromagnetic Field (TEMF) and gamma irradiation on human breast cancer xenograft growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. BACKGROUND: The effects of a rectified semi-sinewave signal (15 mT amplitude, 120 pulses per second, EMF Therapeutics, Inc.) (TEMF) alone and in combination with gamma irradiation (IR) therapy in nude mice bearing a human MDA MB231 breast cancer xenograft were tested. Green fluorescence protein transfected cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of young female mice. Six weeks later, mice were randomly divided into four treatment groups: untreated controls; 10 minute daily TEMF; 200 cGy of IR every other day (total 800 cGy); IR plus daily TEMF. Some mice in each group were euthanized 24 hours after the end of IR. TEMF treatment continued for 3 additional weeks. Tumor sections were stained for: endothelial cells with CD31 and PAS or hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (HIF). RESULTS: Most tumors  less than 35 mm3 were white but tumors  greater than 35 mm3 were pink and had a vascularized capsule. The cortex within 100 microns of the capsule had little vascularization. Blood vessels, capillaries, and endothelial pseudopods were found at  greater than 100 microns from the capsule (subcortex). Tumors  greater than 35 mm3 treated with IR 24 hours previously or with TEMF had decreased blood vessels in the subcortex and more endothelial pseudopods projecting into hypoxic, HIF positive areas than tumors from the control group. Mice that received either IR or TEMF had significantly fewer lung metastatic sites and slower tumor growth than did untreated mice. No harmful side effects were attributed to TEMF. CONCLUSION: TEMF therapy provided a safe means for retarding tumor vascularization, growth and metastasis. </text>

      <text>A novel conotoxin from Conus delessertii with posttranslationally modified lysine residues. A major peptide, de13a from the crude venom of Conus delessertii collected in the Yucatan Channel, Mexico, was purified. The peptide had a high content of posttranslationally modified amino acids, including 6-bromotryptophan and a nonstandard amino acid that proved to be 5-hydroxylysine. This is the first report of 5-hydroxylysine residues in conotoxins. The sequence analysis, together with cDNA cloning and a mass determination (monoisotopic mass of 3486.76 Da), established that the mature toxin has the sequence DCOTSCOTTCANGWECCKGYOCVNKACSGCTH, where O is 4-hydroxyproline, W 6-bromotryptophan, and K 5-hydroxylysine, the asterisk represents the amidated C-terminus, and the calculated monoisotopic mass is 3487.09 Da. The eight Cys residues are arranged in a pattern (C-C-C-CC-C-C-C) not described previously in conotoxins. This arrangement, for which we propose the designation of framework #13 or XIII, differs from the ones (C-C-CC-CC-C-C and C-C-C-C-CC-C-C) present in other conotoxins which also contain eight Cys residues. This peptide thus defines a novel class of conotoxins, with a new posttranslational modification not previously found in other Conus peptide families. </text>

      <text>Enhancement of skin permeation of ketotifen by supersaturation generated by amorphous form of the drug. Pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) matrices containing amorphous ketotifen were prepared and evaluated for enhanced skin permeability of the drug. A solvent casting method using silicone-typed PSA was employed, and n-hexane, an original solvent for the PSA and one more solvent, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, acetone, ethyl acetate or toluene, were used for complete dissolution of ketotifen and high dispersion in an amorphous state of the drug. Presence of the amorphous form was judged based on the in vitro drug release rate from the matrix. As a result, dichloromethane and tetrahudrofuran were selected as appropriate dilution solvents. In vitro permeation experiments through excised hairless mouse skin revealed that the steady-state flux from the amorphous ketotifen-dispersed matrices was about five times greater than that of the crystalline ketotifen-dispersed matrices, and that the enhancement ratio was in good agreement with the solubility ratio of the amorphous to crystalline form of the drug. Comparison of the skin permeation profiles of amorphous ketotifen-dispersed matrices between two different drug contents suggested that the steady-state flux was not influenced by the drug content. In addition, at both drug contents, the period of the steady-state permeation coincided with the time until the amorphous drug was depleted from the matrix. These results suggest that the increase in skin permeation of ketotifen from PSA matrix was due to the supersaturation generated by amorphous form, and that the amorphous form was stable during the application period. </text>

      <text>Polybrominated diphenyl ethers in indoor dust in Ottawa, Canada: implications for sources and exposure. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are widely used as additive flame retardants in plastics, soft furnishings, electrical and electronic equipment, and insulation in the indoor environment, and may be released indoors via volatilization or as dusts. The penta-and octa-brominated mixes are now banned in most parts of Europe, and phasing out of their use has recently begun in North America. This study follows a previous investigation into indoor air levels of PBDEs. House dust was analyzed from the family vacuum cleaners of 68 of the same 74 randomly selected homes, in Ottawa, Canada during the winter of 2002-2003. PBDEs, comprising on average 42% BDE-209, were found in all samples. The levels were log-normally distributed with a geometric mean sigmaPBDE of 2000 ng g(-1), and a median of 1800 ng g(-1) dust. The levels in dust did not correlate with questionnaire information on house characteristics. Correlations were found between pentamix congener levels in dust and in air from the same homes, but not for congeners of the more highly brominated mixes. Exposure scenarios are presented for mean and high dust ingestion rates, and compared against exposures from other pathways, for both adults and toddlers (6 months-2 years). Assuming a mean dust ingestion rate and median dust and air concentrations, adults would be exposed to ca. 7.5 ng sigmaPBDE d(-1) via the dust ingestion pathway, which represents approximately 14% of total daily exposure when compared to diet (82%) and inhalation (4%). However, for toddlers the equivalent intakes would be 99 ng d(-1), representing 80% of their daily PBDE exposure. At high dust ingestion rates these values increase to 180 ng d(-1) (80% daily intake) for adults and 360 ng d(-1) (89% daily intake) for toddlers. The data give a clearer picture of sources of PBDE exposure in the home environment and suggest that dust could be a significant exposure pathway for some individuals, particularly children. </text>

      <text>The threshold level of adenomatous polyposis coli protein for mouse intestinal tumorigenesis.  The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, whose mutations are responsible for familial adenomatous polyposis, is a major negative controller of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. To investigate the dose-dependent effects of APC protein in suppressing intestinal tumorigenesis, we constructed mutant mice carrying hypomorphic Apc alleles Apc(neoR) and Apc(neoF) whose expression levels were reduced to 20% and 10% of the wild type, respectively. Although both hypomorphic heterozygotes developed intestinal polyps, tumor multiplicities were much lower than that in Apc(Delta716) mice, heterozygotes of an Apc null allele. Like in Apc(Delta716) mice, loss of the wild-type Apc allele was confirmed for all polyps examined in the Apc(neoR) and Apc(neoF) mice. In the embryonic stem cells homozygous for these hypomorphic Apc alleles, the level of the APC protein was inversely correlated with both the beta-catenin accumulation and beta-catenin/T-cell factor transcriptional activity. These results suggest that the reduced APC protein level increases intestinal polyp multiplicity through quantitative stimulation of the beta-catenin/T-cell factor transcription. We further estimated the threshold of APC protein level that forms one polyp per mouse as approximately 15% of the wild type. These results also suggest therapeutic implications concerning Wnt signaling inhibitors. </text>

      <text>Pathogenesis of thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera: the role of neutrophils. Thrombotic complications are frequently observed in patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET). Abnormalities of red blood cells and platelets arising from the clonal rearrangement of hematopoietic cells have been considered, although causal relationships between any of these specific abnormalities and thrombosis have not been clearly established. The involvement of neutrophils and macrophages, which participate in thrombosis and hemostasis, has been insufficiently explored in PV and ET. Persistent activation of circulating neutrophils was recently demonstrated in ET and PV patients, in parallel with an increase in plasma concentrations of endothelial damage-derived and prothrombotic substances. Other studies have explored whether the augmentation of adhesion of neutrophils may affect neutrophil/platelet interaction since a significant increase in circulating neutrophil/platelet aggregates is found in ET and PV. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the pathogenesis of thrombosis in PV and ET, with emphasis on the role of neutrophils in hemostasis and their possible involvement in the mechanisms of the acquired thrombophilia of these patients. Available data suggest that these hemostatic markers deserve to be included in prospective clinical studies aimed at identifying their predictive role in the vascular complications of patients with ET and PV. </text>

      <text>The merits of vascular targeting for gynecologic malignancies. Neovascularization is an early and critical step in tumor development and progression. Tumor vessels are distinct from their normal counterparts morphologically as well as at a molecular level. Recent studies on factors involved in tumor vascular development have identified new therapeutic targets for inhibiting tumor neovascularization and thus tumor progression. However, the process of tumor blood vessel formation is complex, and each tumor exhibits unique features in its vasculature. An understanding of the relative contribution of various pathways in the development of tumor vasculature is critical for developing effective and selective therapeutic approaches. Several such agents are currently in clinical trials, and many others are under development. In this review, the mechanisms and factors involved in tumor blood vessel formation are discussed. In addition, selected novel classes of antivascular therapies, including those targeting tumor endothelial cells and other components of the tumor vasculature, are summarized. </text>

      <text>Normal and transforming functions of RUNX1: a perspective.  Converging studies from many investigators indicate that RUNX1 has a critical role in the correct maintenance of essential cellular functions during embryonic development and after birth. The discovery that this gene is also frequently mutated in human leukemia has increased the interest in the role that RUNX1 plays in both normal and transforming pathways. Here, we provide an overview of the many roles of RUNX1 in hematopoietic self-renewal and differentiation and summarize the information that is currently available on the many mechanisms of RUNX1 deregulation in human leukemia. </text>

      <text>Sensitivity variation in two-center holographic recording. An experimental study of variation of sensitivity with recording and sensitizing intensities in two-center recording is presented. The experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. It is shown experimentally, for what is to our knowledge the first time, that the sensitivity is a function of the ratio of recording to sensitizing intensities and not the absolute intensities. Also, the ratio of recording to sensitizing intensities should be small to obtain high sensitivity values. We also report the highest sensitivity (S=0.15 cm/J) that has been achieved to date for a LiNbO3:Fe:Mn crystal. </text>

      <text>Domain 5 of cleaved high molecular weight kininogen inhibits endothelial cell migration through Akt. Domain 5 (D5) of cleaved high molecular weight kininogen (HKa) inhibits angiogenesis in vivo and endothelial cell migration in vitro, but the cell signaling pathways involved in HKa and D5 inhibition of endothelial cell migration are incompletely delineated. This study examines the mechanism of HKa and D5 inhibition of two potent stimulators of endothelial cell migration, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), that act through the P13-kinase-Akt signaling pathway. HKa and D5 inhibit bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cell (BPAE) or human umbilical vein endothelial cell chemotaxis in the modified-Boyden chamber in response toVEGF or S1P. The inhibition of migration by HKa is reversed by antibodies to urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor. Both HKa and D5 decrease the speed of BPAE cell migration and alter the morphology in live, time-lapse microscopy after stimulation with S1P or VEGF. HKa and D5 reduce the localization of paxillin to the focal adhesions after S1P and VEGF stimulation. To better understand the intracellular signaling pathways, we examined the effect of HKa on the phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream effector, GSK-3alpha HKa and D5 inhibit phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3alpha after stimulation withVEGF and S1P. Inhibitors of Akt and P13-kinase, the upstream activator of Akt, block endothelial cell migration and disrupt paxillin localization to the focal adhesions after stimulation with VEGF and S1P. Therefore we suggest that HKa through its D5 domain alters P13-kinase-Akt signaling to inhibit endothelial cell migration through alterations in the focal adhesions. </text>

      <text>Effect of thalidomide affecting VEGF secretion, cell migration, adhesion and capillary tube formation of human endothelial EA.hy 926 cells. Angiogenesis, new blood vessel formation, is a multistep process, precisely regulated by pro-angiogenic cytokines, which stimulate endothelial cells to migrate, proliferate and differentiate to form new capillary microvessels. Excessive vascular development and blood vessel remodeling appears in psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic retinopathy and solid tumors formation. Thalidomide [alpha-(N-phthalimido)-glutarimide] is known to be a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis, but the mechanism of its inhibitory action remains unclear. The aim of the study was to investigate the potential influence of thalidomide on the several steps of angiogenesis, using in vitro models. We have evaluated the effect of thalidomide on VEGF secretion, cell migration, adhesion as well as in capillary formation of human endothelial cell line EA.hy 926. Thalidomide at the concentrations of 0.01 microM and 10 microM inhibited VEGF secretion into supernatants, decreased the number of formed capillary tubes and increased cell adhesion to collagen. Administration of thalidomide at the concentration of 0.01 microM increased cell migration, while at 10 microM, it decreased cell migration. Thalidomide in concentrations from 0.1 microM to 10 microM did not change cell proliferation of 72-h cell cultures. We conclude that anti-angiogenic action of thalidomide is due to direct inhibitory action on VEGF secretion and capillary microvessel formation as well as immunomodulatory influence on EA.hy 926 cells migration and adhesion. </text>

      <text>Regulation of skin microvasculature angiogenesis, cell migration, and permeability by a specific inhibitor of PKCalpha. Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) induces phenotypic changes in the morphology of microvascular endothelial cells that affect major functions of the microvasculature. These functions include the first stages of sprouting in angiogenesis, cell migration following wounding, and vascular permeability. The specific isoform(s) of PKC responsible for each of these changes has not been previously identified. In this study, we used two inflammatory agents, IL-1beta and phorbol myristic acetate, to activate PKC isozymes and specific inhibitors of PKCalpha (Go6976) and PKCbeta (hispidin) to distinguish how each of these isoform(s) controls angiogenesis, wound healing, and permeability. In all cases, only inhibition of PKCalpha inhibited each of these functions when compared to the inhibition of PKCbeta. Additional analysis of the mechanism of action of Go6976 (RT-PCR, Western blots, and immunohistochemistry) of the changes in the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of PKCalpha in the cell membrane and cytoplasm confirmed the specificity of PKCalpha inhibition by Go6976. These studies therefore indicate a specific and a regulatory role of the PKCalpha isoform in three major endothelial cell functions that are important in the maintenance of microvascular homeostasis. </text>

      <text>Recent advances in minisatellite biology. Highly polymorphic tandemly repeated 'minisatellite' loci are very abundant in the human genome, and of considerable utility in human genetic analysis. This review describes the use of an ordered-array Charomid library in the systematic and efficient cloning of these regions, and in the analysis of the relative overlap between the different probes used to screen for hypervariable loci. Recent work on the process of mutation leading to the generation of new-length alleles is also discussed, including the observation that at least some mutations may be due to unequal exchanges. </text>

      <text>The differential regulation of human telomerase reverse transcriptase and vascular endothelial growth factor may contribute to the clinically more aggressive behavior of p63-positive breast carcinomas. p63, a p53 homologue, is a myoepithelial cell marker in the normal mammary gland but p63-positive neoplastic cells may be found in up to 11% of invasive breast carcinomas. This study aims to verify the relationship between p63 expression and several clinicopathological features and tumor markers of clinical significance in breast pathology including key regulators of the cell cycle, oncogenes, apoptosis-related proteins, metalloproteinases and their inhibitors. Immunohistochemistry with 27 primary antibodies was performed in 100 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples of invasive ductal carcinomas. p63-positive cells were found in 16% of carcinomas. p63-positive carcinomas were poorly differentiated, hormone receptor-negative neoplasms with a high proliferation rate. p63 also correlated with advanced pathological stage, tumor size, and the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The expression of TIMP1 suggests that the anti-proteolytic stimuli may be preponderant in p63-positive carcinomas. hTERT activity is associated with nodal metastases and cellular proliferation. VEGF regulates angiogenesis, which is also a fundamental event in the process of tumor growth and metastatic dissemination. Thus, the differential regulation of hTERT and VEGF in p63-positive breast carcinomas may contribute to the clinically more aggressive behavior of these neoplasms. </text>

      <text>Regulation of tumor angiogenesis by thrombospondin-1. Angiogenesis plays a critical role in the growth and metastasis of tumors. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is a potent angiogenesis inhibitor, and down-regulation of TSP-1 has been suggested to alter tumor growth by modulating angiogenesis in a variety of tumor types. Expression of TSP-1 is up-regulated by the tumor suppressor gene, p53, and down-regulated by oncogenes such as Myc and Ras. TSP-1 inhibits angiogenesis by inhibiting endothelial cell migration and proliferation and by inducing apoptosis. In addition, activation of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) by TSP-1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of tumor progression. An understanding of the molecular basis of TSP-1-mediated inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor progression will aid in the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. </text>

      <text>Regulation of the composition of the extracellular matrix by low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1: activities based on regulation of mRNA expression. Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1) is a catabolic receptor for extracellular matrix (ECM) structural proteins and for proteins that bind to ECM. LRP-1 also is implicated in integrin maturation. In this study, we applied a proteomics strategy to identify novel proteins involved in ECM modeling that are regulated by LRP-1. We show that LRP-1 deficiency in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) is associated with increased levels of type III collagen and pigment epithelium-derived factor, which accumulate in the substratum surrounding cells. The collagen receptor, uPAR-AP/Endo-180, is also increased in LRP-1-deficient MEFs. Human LRP-1 reversed the changes in protein expression associated with LRP-1 deficiency; however, the endocytic activity of LRP-1 was not involved. Instead, regulation occurred at the mRNA level. Inhibition of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) blocked type III collagen expression in LRP-1-deficient MEFs, suggesting regulation of JNK activity as a mechanism by which LRP-1 controls mRNA expression. The ability of LRP-1 to regulate expression of the factors identified here suggests a role for LRP-1 in determining blood vessel structure and in angiogenesis. </text>

      <text>L-Carnitine ameliorates methotrexate-induced oxidative organ injury and inhibits leukocyte death.  Methotrexate (MTX), a folic acid antagonist widely used for the treatment of a variety of tumors and inflammatory diseases, affects normal tissues that have a high rate of proliferation, including the hematopoietic cells of the bone marrow and the gastrointestinal mucosal cells. To elucidate the role of free radicals and leukocytes in MTX-induced oxidative organ damage and the putative protective effect of L-carnitine (L-Car), Wistar albino rats were administered a single dose of MTX (20 mg/kg) followed by either saline or L-Car (500 mg/kg) for 5 days. After decapitation of the rats, trunk blood was obtained, and the ileum, liver, and kidney were removed for histological examination and for the measurement of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and collagen content. Our results showed that MTX administration increased the MDA and MPO activities and collagen content and decreased GSH levels in all tissues, while these alterations were reversed in L-Car-treated group. The elevated serum TNF-alpha level observed following MTX treatment was depressed with L-Car. The oxidative burst of neutrophils stimulated by Annexin V was reduced in the saline-treated MTX group, while L-Car abolished this inhibition. Similarly, flow cytometric measurements revealed that leukocyte apoptosis was increased in MTX-treated animals, while L-Car reversed these effects. Severe degeneration of the intestinal mucosa, liver parenchyma, and glomerular and tubular epithelium observed in the saline-treated MTX group was improved by L-Car treatment. These results suggest that L-Car, possibly via its free radical scavenging and antioxidant properties, ameliorates MTX-induced oxidative organ injury and inhibits leukocyte apoptosis. Thus, supplementation with L-Carnitine as an adjuvant therapy may be promising in alleviating the systemic side-effects of chemotherapeutics. </text>

      <text>Pericytes limit tumor cell metastasis. Previously we observed that neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) deficiency in beta tumor cells facilitates metastasis into distant organs and local lymph nodes. Here, we show that NCAM-deficient beta cell tumors grew leaky blood vessels with perturbed pericyte-endothelial cell-cell interactions and deficient perivascular deposition of ECM components. Conversely, tumor cell expression of NCAM in a fibrosarcoma model (T241) improved pericyte recruitment and increased perivascular deposition of ECM molecules. Together, these findings suggest that NCAM may limit tumor cell metastasis by stabilizing the microvessel wall. To directly address whether pericyte dysfunction increases the metastatic potential of solid tumors, we studied beta cell tumorigenesis in primary pericyte-deficient Pdgfb(ret/ret) mice. This resulted in beta tumor cell metastases in distant organs and local lymph nodes, demonstrating a role for pericytes in limiting tumor cell metastasis. These data support a new model for how tumor cells trigger metastasis by perturbing pericyte-endothelial cell-cell interactions. </text>

      <text>NF-kappaB and IKK as therapeutic targets in cancer. The transcription factor NF-kappaB and associated regulatory factors (including IkappaB kinase subunits and the IkappaB family member Bcl-3) are strongly implicated in a variety of hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. A role for NF-kappaB in cancer cells appears to involve regulation of cell proliferation, control of apoptosis, promotion of angiogenesis, and stimulation of invasion/metastasis. Consistent with a role for NF-kappaB in oncogenesis are observations that inhibition of NF-kappaB alone or in combination with cancer therapies leads to tumor cell death or growth inhibition. However, other experimental data indicate that NF-kappaB can play a tumor suppressor role in certain settings and that it can be important in promoting an apoptotic signal downstream of certain cancer therapy regimens. In order to appropriately move NF-kappaB inhibitors in the clinic, thorough approaches must be initiated to determine the molecular mechanisms that dictate the complexity of oncologic and therapeutic outcomes that are controlled by NF-kappaB. </text>

      <text>Runx2 and MYC collaborate in lymphoma development by suppressing apoptotic and growth arrest pathways in vivo.  Members of the Runx and MYC families have been implicated as collaborating oncogenes. The mechanism of this potent collaboration is elucidated in this study of Runx2/MYC mice. As shown previously, ectopic expression of Runx2 in the thymus leads to a preneoplastic state defined by an accumulation of cells with an immature phenotype and a low proliferative rate. We now show that c-MYC overexpression is sufficient to rescue proliferation and to release the differentiation block imposed by Runx2. Analysis of Runx2-expressing lymphomas reveals a consistently low rate of apoptosis, in contrast to lymphomas of MYC mice which are often highly apoptotic. The low apoptosis phenotype is dominant in Runx2/MYC tumors, indicating that Runx2 confers a potent survival advantage to MYC-expressing tumor cells. The role of the p53 pathway in Runx2/MYC tumors was explored on a p53 heterozygote background. Surprisingly, functional p53 was retained in vivo, even after transplantation, whereas explanted tumor cells displayed rapid allele loss in vitro. Our results show that Runx2 and MYC overcome distinct "fail-safe" responses and that their selection as collaborating genes is due to their ability to neutralize each other's negative growth effect. Furthermore, the Runx2/MYC combination overcomes the requirement for genetic inactivation of the p53 pathway in vivo. </text>

      <text>Inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) by rapamycin increases chemosensitivity of CaSki cells to paclitaxel.  Paclitaxel, a potent anti-neoplastic agent, has been found to be effective against several tumours, including cervical cancer. However, the exact mechanism underlying the cytotoxic effects of pacitaxel, especially in the survival-signalling pathway, is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular pathway of the cytotoxic effect of paclitaxel in human cervical cancer cell lines. Four human cervical cancer cell lines were treated for 24 h with various concentration of paclitaxel, and the sensitivity was analysed by an MTT assay. The cell cycle progression and sub-G1 population were analysed by flow cytometry. Apoptosis was further measured by DNA fragmentation and microscope examination. The protein expression was determined by Western blot analysis. Our results showed that HeLa cells demonstrated the highest sensitivity to paclitaxel, whereas CaSki cells showed the lowest. In cervical cancer cells, paclitaxel induced apoptosis through an intrinsic pathway with prior G2/M arrest. In addition, we showed that paclitaxel downregulated the phosphorylation of Akt in both HeLa and CaSki cells. Interestingly, in CaSki cells, which were more suggestive of a resistant phenotype, paclitaxel induced the activation of mTOR as a downstream target of Akt. Pre-treatment with rapamycin inhibited activation of mTOR signalling and significantly enhanced the sensitivity of CaSki cells to paclitaxel by increasing apoptotic cell death. This effect was mediated, at least partly, through caspase activation. Overall, paclitaxel exerts its anti-tumour effects on cervical cancer cells by inducing apoptosis through intrinsic pathway, and rapamycin targeted to mTOR can sensitise paclitaxel-resistant cervical cancer cells. </text>

      <text>Circulating endothelial cells in malignant disease. Cancer is a disease largely dependent on neoangiogenesis. Cancer neoangiogenesis is often disordered and abnormal, with evidence of coexisting vascular endothelial dysfunction. A novel method of assessing vascular endothelial function in cancer is via the quantification of circulating endothelial cells (CEC). Unusual in healthy individuals, their presence in elevated numbers often indicates substantial vascular endothelial perturbation. Another interesting cell type is the endothelial progenitor cell (EPC), whose numbers increase in the presence of vascular damage. Recent research suggests that EPCs have an important role in tumor vasculogenesis. Another marker being investigated in the context of vascular dysfunction and coagulopathy is the endothelial microparticle (EMP). Thus, CECs, EPCs and EMPs may represent potentially novel methods for evaluating the vascular status of cancer patients. This review will summarize the current position of CECs, EPCs and EMPs in cell biology terms, with particular emphasis on their relationship to malignant disease. </text>

      <text>The ictal bradycardia syndrome: localization and lateralization. PURPOSE: Previous studies have established the importance of the insular cortex and temporal lobe in cardiovascular autonomic modulation. Some investigators, based on the results of cortical stimulation response, functional imaging, EEG recordings of seizures, and lesional studies, have suggested that cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic function may be lateralized, with sympathetic representation lateralized to the right insula, and parasympathetic, to the left. These studies have suggested that ictal bradycardia is most commonly a manifestation of activation of the left temporal and insular cortex. However, the evidence for this is inconsistent. We sought to assess critically the predictable value of ictal bradycardia for seizure localization and lateralization. METHODS: In this study, we reviewed the localization of seizure activity in 13 consecutive patients with ictal bradycardia diagnosed during prolonged video-EEG monitoring at Mayo Clinic Rochester. The localization of electrographic seizure activity at seizure onset and bradycardia onset was identified in all patients. In addition, we performed a comprehensive review of the ictal bradycardia literature focusing on localization of seizure activity in ictal bradycardia cases. RESULTS: All occurrences of ictal bradycardia in the 13 identified patients were associated with temporal lobe-onset seizures. However, no consistent lateralization of seizure activity was found at onset of seizure activity or at onset of bradycardia in this population. Seizure activity was bilateral at bradycardia onset in nine of 13 patients. The results from the literature review also showed that a predominance of patients had bilateral activity at bradycardia onset; however, more of the ictal bradycardia cases from the literature had left hemispheric localization of seizure onset. CONCLUSIONS: Ictal bradycardia most often occurs in association with bilateral hemispheric seizure activity and is not a consistent lateralizing sign in localizing seizure onset. Our data do not support the existence of a strictly unilateral parasympathetic cardiomotor representation in the left hemisphere, as has been suggested. </text>

      <text>GDP and AGE receptors: mechanisms of peritoneal damage. Long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD) is limited by morphological changes of the peritoneal membrane. Structural changes were promoted by toxicity of glucose degradation products (GDPs) which are generated during heat sterilization in peritoneal dialysis fluids (PDFs). Besides their direct toxicity GDPs promote formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). RAGE (receptor for AGE) is the best characterized signal transduction receptor for AGEs and is expressed on mesothelial cells. The effects of PDFs with different amounts of GDPs were compared on morphological changes in the peritoneal membrane in a RAGE -/- mouse model. It could be demonstrated that RAGE plays a pivotal role in structural damage (e.g. inflammation, neoangiogenesis and fibrosis) of the peritoneal membrane. Further investigations of this pathway with regard to preventing peritoneal fibrosis should be performed to maintain the integrity of the peritoneal membrane in peritoneal dialysis patients. </text>

      <text>Hyperfibrinogenemia is associated with lymphatic as well as hematogenous metastasis and worse clinical outcome in T2 gastric cancer.  BACKGROUND: Abnormal hemostasis in cancer patients has previously been described, however the correlation between the plasma fibrinogen level and cancer metastasis and prognosis has not been reported in a large-scale clinical study. METHODS: Preoperative plasma fibrinogen levels were retrospectively examined in 405 patients who underwent surgery for advanced gastric cancer. The association of fibrinogen levels with clinical/pathological findings and clinical outcome was evaluated. RESULTS: There was a positive correlation between plasma fibrinogen levels and the depth of invasion (p &lt; 0.05). Hyperfibrinogenemia (&gt;310 mg/dl) was independently associated with lymph node (Odds Ratio; 2.342, P = 0.0032) and liver (Odds Ratio; 2.933, P = 0.0147) metastasis, not with peritoneal metastasis in this series. Patients with hyperfibrinogenemia showed worse clinical outcome in T2 gastric cancer, however, there was no correlation of plasma fibrinogen level with prognosis in T3/T4 gastric cancer. CONCLUSION: Our results might support the idea that hyperfibrinogenemia can augment lymphatic and hematogeneous metastasis of advanced gastric cancer, which is major determinant of the prognosis in T2 gastric cancer. Therefore, in the situation without peritoneal involvement, hyperfibrinogenemia is a useful biomarker to predict the possible metastasis and worse clinical outcome in T2 gastric cancer. </text>

      <text>Dendrimer-templated Fe nanoparticles for the growth of single-wall carbon nanotubes by plasma-enhanced CVD. A fourth-generation (G4) poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer (G4-NH2) has been used as a template to deliver nearly monodispersed catalyst nanoparticles to SiO2/Si, Ti/Si, sapphire, and porous anodic alumina (PAA) substrates. Fe2O3 nanoparticles obtained after calcination of the immobilized Fe3+/G4-NH2 composite served as catalytic "seeds" for the growth of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) by microwave plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD). To surmount the difficulty associated with SWNT growth via PECVD, reaction conditions that promote the stabilization of Fe nanoparticles, resulting in enhanced SWNT selectivity and quality, have been identified. In particular, in situ annealing of Fe catalyst in an N2 atmosphere was found to improve SWNT selectivity and quality. H2 prereduction at 900 degrees C for 5 min was also found to enhance SWNT selectivity and quality for SiO2/Si supported catalyst, albeit of lower quality for sapphire supported catalyst. The application of positive dc bias voltage (+200 V) during SWNT growth was shown to be very effective in removing amorphous carbon impurities while enhancing graphitization, SWNT selectivity, and vertical alignment. The results of this study should promote the use of exposed Fe nanoparticles supported on different substrates for the growth of high-quality SWNTs by PECVD. </text>

      <text>Fluoro-Jade B staining following zymosan microinjection into the spinal cord white matter. 1. The fluorescein derivate Fluoro-Jade B (FJB), which primarily labels dead or dying neurons, was used to study the acute focal inflammation in the spinal cord white matter. Inflammation was induced by microinjection of the yeast particulate zymosan to evaluate the biological effects of intraspinal macrophages activation without the confounding effects of physical trauma. 2. A single bolus of zymosan (Sigma, 75 nL) was stereotaxically injected at the thoracic level into the lateral white matter of rat spinal cord. A standard Fluoro-Jade B staining protocol was applied to spinal cord sections at 6, 12, 24 h and 2, 4 days postinjection. Neutral Red, NADPH-diaphorase, Iba1-IR, and DAPI staining protocols accomplished examination of the cells participating in the acute inflammatory response. 3. Zymosan caused formation of clearly delineated inflammation lesions localized in the lateral white matter of the spinal cord. Fluoro-Jade B stained cells in the area of inflammation were not observed at 12 h postinjection while mild FJB staining appeared at 24 h and intense staining was observed at 2 and 4 days postinjection. 4. This study shows that the acute response to zymosan-induced inflammation in the rat spinal cord white matter causes a gradual appearance of phagocytic microglia/macrophages and delayed FJB staining of the inflammatory cells. 5. FJB, a reliable marker of dying neurons, is a more universal agent than formerly believed. One possible explanation for the gradual appearance of FJB-stained cells in the area of inflammation is that specific time is required for sufficient levels of proteins and/or myelin debris of axonal origin to appear in the cytoplasm of phagocytic microglia/macrophages. </text>

      <text>Defective expression of HRK is associated with promoter methylation in primary central nervous system lymphomas.  OBJECTIVES: Recently, it has been reported that expression of the HRK gene was significantly reduced by hypermethylation in astrocytic tumors. Our aim is to verify the alterations in the HRK gene in primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSLs). METHODS: We analyzed the hypermethylation status and expression of the gene and 12q13.1 loss of heterozygosity in 31 PCNSLs. RESULTS: A total of 13 PCNSLs (31%) demonstrated hypermethylation in either the promoter or exon 1; loss of HRK expression was immunohistochemically observed in 9 tumors and was significantly associated with promoter methylation. In addition, higher apoptotic counts were associated with HRK positivity. PCNSLs with HRK methylation also showed methylation of multiple genes, such as p14ARF, p16INK4a, RB1, p27Kip1 and O6-MGMT. Patients with tumors demonstrating concurrent methylation of more than half of their genes demonstrated significantly poorer survival and earlier recurrence. Hypermethylation of the HRK promoter alone was not associated with overall outcome, but relapse-free survival was significantly shorter. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that transcriptional repression of HRK is caused by promoter hypermethylation in PCNSL, and that the loss of HRK associated with the methylation profile of other genes is a potential step in the modulation of cellular death by apoptosis during PCNSL tumorigenesis. </text>

      <text>Changes of lymphocyte subsets in leukemia patients who received allogenic bone marrow transplantation. Proportional changes of lymphocyte subsets in the peripheral blood were monitored by two-color flow-cytometry in seven leukemia patients who had received allogenic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Lymphocyte counts, and proportions of T and B-cells returned to normal ranges between the 2nd and 12th months after BMT. Activated T-cells prominently increased after BMT, and the values gradually returned toward normal. As to lymphocyte subsets, the proportions of CD 4+ cells had remained low, while those of CD 8+ cells high for a whole observation period after BMT. The changes of CD 4+ cells were caused by the decrease of suppressor-inducer T-cells (CD 4+ Leu 8+). High proportion of CD 8+ cells was mainly associated with increased suppressor T-cells (CD 8+ CD 11+). Among natural killer (NK) cells, highly active NK cells (CD 16+ CD 57-) markedly increased shortly after BMT, and gradually returned to normal. CD 16 -CD 57+ NK cells increased beyond normal ranges after the 2nd month. The incidence or degree of acute and chronic graft-versus-host diseases (GVHD) did not correlate with the changes of any lymphocyte subsets. The present results suggest that the increase of activated T-cells shortly after BMT reflects lymphocyte reconstitution. The prolonged immune deficiency after BMT might be related to either deficient expression of homing receptor (Leu 8 antigen) on CD 4+ cells or increased suppressor T-cells (CD 8+ CD 11+). In addition, the early increase of NK cells after BMT may compensate for the immune deficiency in BMT patients. </text>

      <text>Fluoroscopically guided cervical prolotherapy for instability with blinded pre and post radiographic reading. BACKGROUND: Several authors have postulated that cervical instability is a major cause of traumatic spinal pain. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this prospective case series study (n = 6) was to determine if proliferant injections have an effect on cervical translation as measured by a blinded reader. DESIGN: This study was a prospective case series. Study participants were selected from patients seen for the primary complaint of Motor Vehicle Collision related neck pain in a private sub-specialty pain clinic. METHODS: Flexion and extension views were obtained by standard radiographs taken with a C-Arm fluoroscope under Valium sedation. Patients with more than 2.7 mm of absolute cervical translation and at least 50% reduction of cervical and referred pain with a two day rigid cervical immobilization test were admitted into the study. Participants underwent 3 prolotherapy injections at all sites that demonstrated translation. The difference in means between pre-test and post-test measurements (flexion translation, extension translation, and pain VAS scores) were assessed by a Wilcoxon signed ranks test (alpha = 0.05). RESULTS: The mean post-test VAS score (M= 3.83, SD=2.3, t=2.889) was significantly less (p=0.04) than the mean pre-test VAS score (M=5.75, SD=1.94). The correlation between difference in mean extension at C2-3 and C5-6 and difference in mean extension was significant (rho=0.89, p=0.02 and rho=0.85, p=0.03 respectively). Difference in mean flexion at C3-4 and C4-5 was significantly correlated with difference in mean flexion (rho=0.88, p=0.02 and rho=0.941, p &lt;0.01 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate statistically significant correlations between proliferant injections, a reduction of both cervical flexion and extension translation, as well as a reduction in pain VAS score. Since patients with traumatic cervical instability have few viable treatment options other than surgical fusion, cervical proliferant injections under C-Arm fluoroscope may be a viable treatment option. </text>

      <text>Differential mechanisms of radiosensitization by 2-deoxy-D-glucose in the monolayers and multicellular spheroids of a human glioma cell line. In vitro studies using monolayer cultures of human tumor cell lines have shown that 2-DG selectively inhibits energy-dependent DNA repair and cellular recovery processes in cancer cells. However, monolayer cultures differ greatly from the complex environmental conditions generated in solid tumors that develop inhomogeneous hypoxic and necrotic regions. In contrast, multicellular spheroids mimic heterogeneous cellular behavior and the consequent functional characteristics of in vivo solid tumors, and serve as important in vitro model to investigate tumor biology and responses to potential therapeutic agents. The present study compares the radiomodification by 2-DG in monolayer cultures and spheroids of a human glioma cell line (BMG-1) to gain insight into the effects in solid tumors. In spheroids, the glucose consumption (2.1 p mole/cell/h) and lactate production (3.67 p mole/cell/h) was nearly 2-3 fold higher than in monolayer cells (0.83 and 1.43 p mole/cell/h respectively). Presence of 2-DG (5 mM) for 2-4 h inhibited the glucose usage and lactate production by 70% in spheroids, while a 35% reduction was observed in monolayer cells. Under these conditions, 2-DG drastically enhanced the radiation-induced cell death of spheroids (by 2-3 folds); while a 40% increase was observed in monolayer cells. Radiosensitization by 2-DG in monolayer cells was primarily due to an increase in mitotic death (23%) linked to cytogenetic damage (micronuclei), whereas a profound induction of apoptosis (40%) accounted for the sensitization in spheroids. Although the Bcl-2 and Bax levels were significantly higher in spheroids, Bcl-2/Bax ratio was similar in monolayers and spheroids. Comet assay revealed a late onset of DNA breaks in the presence of 2- DG following irradiation only in spheroids, which corroborated well with the late onset of oxidative stress. 2-DG did not induce a significant cell cycle delay in monolayers, while a transient G(2) delay was apparent in spheroids. </text>

      <text>[Autologous bone marrow stem cell or peripheral blood endothelial progenitor cell therapy in patients with peripheral limb ischaemia] No effective medical therapies have been developed sofar to enhance blood flow in the legs of patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). For patients with limb threatening ischaemia the only option for relief of rest pain or gangraena is amputation. There is evidence in experimental and clinical studies that adult bone marrow-derived stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells participate in the development of new blood vessels, called neoangiogenesis or neovascularization. Clinical results induced by autologous bone marrow stem cells or angiogenic growth/differentiation factors in end-stage patients with PAD are summarized. Considering the relatively few number of patients treated by angiogenic therapy, the interpretation of clinical results needs cautiousness. </text>

      <text>Formation of new bone during vertical distraction osteogenesis of the human mandible is related to the presence of blood vessels. We examined the effect of distraction rate on blood vessel growth in intramembraneous ossification after vertical distraction osteogenesis in the human mandible. Six edentulous patients (aged 60+/-9 years) with a severely atrophic mandible underwent bone augmentation with distraction osteogenesis. Two distraction rates (0.5 and 1 mm/day) were compared and for each group three patients were analyzed. Vascular histomorphometry was carried out in two different areas in the distraction gap: (1) in the first and (2) in the second 1 mm area from the osteotomy line, representing the oldest and younger new-bone area, respectively. Correlation analysis was performed between blood vessel parameters and the amount of new bone formed during distraction. Histological analysis demonstrated the presence of blood vessels throughout the soft connective tissue in the distraction gap. The volume density of blood vessels between the two investigated areas was significantly lower in the 1 mm/day groups, suggesting a delay in angiogenesis in this group of patients. A positive correlation between blood vessel volume and bone volume density was found in the younger new-bone area but not in the oldest new-bone area. This correlation was due to a higher number of blood vessels rather than to a larger size of the blood vessels. Our data suggest that the lower blood vessel density found in the patients with 1 mm/day distraction rate may be related to disruption of angiogenesis in the soft connective tissue of the gap or to a less optimal mechanical stimulation of cells involved in angiogenesis. This probably results in the slower rate of osteogenesis seen at the 1 mm/day distraction rate compared with the 0.5 mm/day distraction rate. The data support the concept that a positive relationship exists between the density of blood vessels and the formation of bone. For distraction of the human mandible in elderly patients, a distraction rate of 0.5 mm/day seems beneficial. </text>

      <text>[The prevalence of ADHD and attention problems in preschool-aged children. A comparison of two diagnostic instruments]. OBJECTIVES: In order to analyse the prevalence of ADHD and attention problems in preschool-aged children, mothers were asked to rate their children using two measuring instruments. METHODS: The analysis is part of a prospective, randomised control study of N = 280 children aged three to six years, whose mothers rated them using the Child Behaviour Checklist/CBCL 1 1/2-5 and the Parent Rating Scale for Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). RESULTS: The prevalence rates ranged from 2.7% to 9.9%. There was no significant gender effect in this age group. CONCLUSIONS: The study delivers initial findings and provides support for decisions to implement in Germany new assessment methods for preschool-aged children with ADHD or hyperkinetic syndrome. Finally, the different rates of prevalence and the implications of the findings for epidemiology and the prevention of ADHD and attention problems among preschool-aged children are discussed. </text>

      <text>Medical adherence and childhood chronic illness: family daily management skills and emotional climate as emerging contributors. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe recent research that examines family factors that promote or derail adherence to medical regimens for children with chronic health conditions, primarily asthma, diabetes, and cystic fibrosis. From the past 2 years, eight correlational studies were identified which specifically examined the links between family management strategies, family climate and medical adherence. RECENT FINDINGS: Findings from the studies suggest that team-based management strategies and cohesive family climate promote adherence to medical treatments over time. Family interactions that are characterized by conflict and disengagement tend to disrupt adherence and inevitably cause a decline in child health. Moreover, these findings seem to be moderated by child age in that poorer adherence often occurs when a child reaches adolescence and is searching for greater autonomy. SUMMARY: Future research should consider the challenges in measuring medical adherence in the family context as well as incorporating more naturalistic studies of family interactions. Randomized controlled trials using family-based interventions may consider focusing on medical adherence as an important mediator between family process and child health outcomes. </text>

      <text>Neoplastic transformation of ciliary body epithelium is associated with loss of opticin expression.  BACKGROUND: Opticin is a recently discovered glycoprotein present predominantly in the vitreous humour. It is synthesised and secreted by the ciliary body epithelium (CBE) from the initiation of CBE development in the embryo, and production continues throughout life. AIM: To determine whether a variety of ciliary body tumours synthesise opticin to characterise further its role in ciliary body health and disease. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the distribution of opticin in normal human CBE, and in hyperplastic and neoplastic CBE lesions. RESULTS: Opticin was immunolocalised to the basal cell surface and basement membrane material of the non-pigmented CBE in nine donor eyes as well as four hyperplastic lesions of the CBE (Fuchs's adenoma). By contrast, none of eight neoplastic lesions (two adenoma and six adenocarcinoma) of CBE stained for opticin. CONCLUSION: The present series supports the theory that opticin is produced by the non-pigmented CBE throughout adult life. Loss of opticin expression by this tissue is associated with and could contribute towards neoplastic transformation. </text>

      <text>Imaging tumor angiogenesis. Since the discovery of vascular-specific growth factors with angiogenic activity, there has been a significant effort to develop cancer drugs that restrict tumorigenesis by targeting the blood supply. In this issue of the JCI, Mancuso et al. use mouse models to better understand the plasticity of the tumor vasculature in the face of antiangiogenic therapy (see the related article beginning on page 2610). They describe a rapid regrowth of the tumor vasculature following withdrawal of VEGFR inhibitors, emphasizing the importance of fully understanding the function of these and similar treatments used in the clinic at the cellular and molecular level. </text>

      <text>Collagen-poly glycolic acid hybrid matrix with basic fibroblast growth factor accelerated angiogenesis and granulation tissue formation in diabetic mice. Because poor skin wound healing associated with diabetes is thought to be partly a result from impaired angiogenesis, treatments that improve angiogenesis could have important clinical applications. We herein report the effects of novel developed material, collagen-poly glycolic acid fiber hybrid matrix, being used together with basic fibroblast growth factor to promote wound healing of full-thickness skin defects on the back of type 2 diabetic Lepr(db) mice. Our data indicates that this therapeutic approach markedly promotes angiogenesis and granulation tissue formation in comparison with other conditions 14 days after wounding. </text>

      <text>p18Ink4c, but not p27Kip1, collaborates with Men1 to suppress neuroendocrine organ tumors.  Mutant mice lacking both cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p18(Ink4c) and p27(Kip1) develop a tumor spectrum reminiscent of human multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes. To determine how p18 and p27 genetically interact with Men1, the tumor suppressor gene mutated in familial MEN1, we characterized p18-Men1 and p27-Men1 double mutant mice. Compared with their corresponding single mutant littermates, the p18(-/-); Men1(+/-) mice develop tumors at an accelerated rate and with an increased incidence in the pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, and pancreas. In the pituitary and pancreatic islets, phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein at both CDK2 and CDK4/6 sites was increased in p18(-/-) and Men1(+/-) cells and was further increased in p18(-/-); Men1(+/-) cells. The remaining wild-type Men1 allele was lost in most tumors from Men1(+/-) mice but was retained in most tumors from p18(-/-); Men1(+/-) mice. Combined mutations of p27(-/-) and Men1(+/-), in contrast, did not exhibit noticeable synergistic stimulation of Rb kinase activity, cell proliferation, and tumor growth. These results demonstrate that functional collaboration exists between p18 and Men1 and suggest that Men1 may regulate additional factor(s) that interact with p18 and p27 differently. </text>

      <text>Punica granatum (pomegranate) and its potential for prevention and treatment of inflammation and cancer. The last 7 years have seen over seven times as many publications indexed by Medline dealing with pomegranate and Punica granatum than in all the years preceding them. Because of this, and the virtual explosion of interest in pomegranate as a medicinal and nutritional product that has followed, this review is accordingly launched. The pomegranate tree, Punica granatum, especially its fruit, possesses a vast ethnomedical history and represents a phytochemical reservoir of heuristic medicinal value. The tree/fruit can be divided into several anatomical compartments: (1) seed, (2) juice, (3) peel, (4) leaf, (5) flower, (6) bark, and (7) roots, each of which has interesting pharmacologic activity. Juice and peels, for example, possess potent antioxidant properties, while juice, peel and oil are all weakly estrogenic and heuristically of interest for the treatment of menopausal symptoms and sequellae. The use of juice, peel and oil have also been shown to possess anticancer activities, including interference with tumor cell proliferation, cell cycle, invasion and angiogenesis. These may be associated with plant based anti-inflammatory effects, The phytochemistry and pharmacological actions of all Punica granatum components suggest a wide range of clinical applications for the treatment and prevention of cancer, as well as other diseases where chronic inflammation is believed to play an essential etiologic role. </text>

      <text>Activation of vascular endothelial growth factor through reactive oxygen species mediates 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid-induced endothelial cell proliferation. 20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) is formed by the omega-hydroxylation of arachidonic acid by cytochrome P450 4A and 4F enzymes, and it induces angiogenic responses in vivo. To test the hypothesis that 20-HETE increases endothelial cell (EC) proliferation via vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), we studied the effects of WIT003 [20-hydroxyeicosa-5(Z),14(Z)-dienoic acid], a 20-HETE analog on human macrovascular or microvascular EC. WIT003, as well as pure 20-HETE, stimulated EC proliferation by approximately 40%. These proliferative effects were accompanied by increased VEGF expression and release that were observed as early as 4 h after 20-HETE agonist addition. This was accompanied by increased phosphorylation of the VEGF receptor 2. The proliferative effects of 20-HETE were markedly inhibited by a VEGF-neutralizing antibody. Polyethylene glycol-superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD) markedly inhibited both the increases in VEGF expression and the proliferative effects of 20-HETE. In contrast, administration of the NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor apocynin had no effect to the proliferative response to 20-HETE. The 20-HETE agonist markedly increased superoxide formation as reflected by an increase in dihydroethidium staining of EC, and this increase was inhibited by PEG-SOD but not by apocynin. 20-HETE also increased the phosphorylation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in EC, whereas an inhibitor of MAPK [U0126, 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(2-aminophenylthio)butadiene] suppressed the proliferative and the VEGF changes but not the pro-oxidant effects of 20-HETE. These data suggest that 20-HETE stimulates superoxide formation by pathways other than apocynin-sensitive NAD(P)H oxidase, thereby activating MAPK and then enhancing VEGF synthesis that drives EC proliferation. Thus, 20-HETE may be involved in the regulation of EC functions, such as angiogenesis. </text>

      <text>Relationship of cellular immunity, cytokines and CRP with clinical course in breast cancer patients with endocrine-dependent distant metastases treated with immunotherapy.  We have reported important benefits and survival with an immunotherapy schedule in patients with endocrine-dependent breast cancer and distant metastases. Here clinical outcome is updated and its correlation with new immunological data is shown. In 32 evaluated breast cancer patients with endocrine-dependent distant metastases treated with a new immunotherapy schedule (cyclic administration of beta-interferon and interleukin-2), cellular immunity, cytokines and CRP were related to the clinical course. Estimated and true 5-10 year overall survival rates from first line antiestrogen and distant metastases were higher than previously reported in a similar population. Interleukin-2 administration was followed by a significant increase in total lymphocytes, CD4+, CD8+, CD16+56+ (NK) cells, IL-6, IL-12, and CRP (from P&lt;0.04 to P&lt;0.000) but no change in IL-10 and TGFbeta1 during clinical benefit. During progressive disease no change was observed in the former parameters, concomitant with a significant increase in IL-10 (P=0.020) and a significant decrease in TGFbeta1 (P=0.023). These findings confirm that cellular immunity is significantly stimulated by IL-2 only during clinical benefit. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that different changes of proinflammatory cytokines, CRP and inhibiting factors are consistent with associated clinical benefit or with disease progression, respectively. </text>

      <text>Trib1 and Evi1 cooperate with Hoxa and Meis1 in myeloid leukemogenesis.  Cooperative activation of Meis1 and Hoxa9 perturbs myeloid differentiation and eventually leads myeloid progenitors to leukemia, yet it remains to be clarified what kinds of subsequent molecular processes are required for development of overt leukemia. To understand the molecular pathway in Hoxa9/Meis1-induced leukemogenesis, retroviral insertional mutagenesis was applied using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. The mice that received Hoxa9/Meis1-transduced bone marrow cells developed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and Trib1, Evi1, Ahi1, Raralpha, Pitpnb, and AK039950 were identified as candidate cooperative genes located near common retroviral integration sites. Trib1 and Evi1 were up-regulated due to retroviral insertions, and coexpression of these genes significantly accelerated the onset of Hoxa9/Meis1-induced AML, suggesting that Trib1 and Evi1 are the key collaborators. Furthermore, Trib1 by itself is a novel myeloid oncogene, enhancing phosphorylation of ERK, resulting in inhibition of apoptosis. These results demonstrate the importance of specific oncogene interaction in myeloid leukemogenesis. </text>

      <text>Pro/antioxidant status and AP-1 transcription factor in murine skin following topical exposure to cumene hydroperoxide.  Organic peroxides, widely used in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, can act as skin tumor promoters and cause epidermal hyperplasia. They are also known to trigger free radical generation. The present study evaluated the effect of cumene hydroperoxide (Cum-OOH) on the induction of activator protein-1 (AP-1), which is linked to the expression of genes regulating cell proliferation, growth and transformation. Previously, we reported that topical exposure to Cum-OOH caused formation of free radicals and oxidative stress in the skin of vitamin E-deficient mice. The present study used JB6 P+ mouse epidermal cells and AP-1-luciferase reporter transgenic mice to identify whether exposure to Cum-OOH caused activation of AP-1, oxidative stress, depletion of antioxidants and tumor formation during two-stage carcinogenesis. In vitro studies found that exposure to Cum-OOH reduced the level of glutathione (GSH) in mouse epidermal cells (JB6 P+) and caused the induction of AP-1. Mice primed with dimethyl-benz[a]anthracene (DMBA) were topically exposed to Cum-OOH (82.6 micromol) or the positive control, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA, 17 nmol), twice weekly for 29 weeks. Activation of AP-1 in skin was detected as early as 2 weeks following Cum-OOH or TPA exposure. No AP-1 expression was found 19 weeks after initiation. Papilloma formation was observed in both the DMBA-TPA- and DMBA-Cum-OOH-exposed animals, whereas skin carcinomas were found only in the DMBA-Cum-OOH-treated mice. A greater accumulation of peroxidative products (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances), inflammation and decreased levels of GSH and total antioxidant reserves were also observed in the skin of DMBA-Cum-OOH-exposed mice. These results suggest that Cum-OOH-induced carcinogenesis is accompanied by increased AP-1 activation and changes in antioxidant status. </text>

      <text>Hyperforin blocks neutrophil activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9, motility and recruitment, and restrains inflammation-triggered angiogenesis and lung fibrosis. Hyperforin (Hyp), a polyphenol-derivative of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), has emerged as key player not only in the antidepressant activity of the plant but also as an inhibitor of bacteria lymphocyte and tumor cell proliferation, and matrix proteinases. We tested whether as well as inhibiting leukocyte elastase (LE) activity, Hyp might be effective in containing both polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) leukocyte recruitment and unfavorable eventual tissue responses. The results show that, without affecting in vitro human PMN viability and chemokine-receptor expression, Hyp (as stable dicyclohexylammonium salt) was able to inhibit in a dose-dependent manner their chemotaxis and chemoinvasion (IC50=1 microM for both); this effect was associated with a reduced expression of the adhesion molecule CD11b by formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-stimulated neutrophils and block of LE-triggered activation of the gelatinase matrix metalloproteinase-9. PMN-triggered angiogenesis is also blocked by both local injection and daily i.p. administration of the Hyp salt in an interleukin-8-induced murine model. Furthermore, i.p. treatment with Hyp reduces acute PMN recruitment and enhances resolution in a pulmonary bleomycin-induced inflammation model, significantly reducing consequent fibrosis. These results indicate that Hyp is a powerful anti-inflammatory compound with therapeutic potential, and they elucidate mechanistic keys. </text>

      <text>New vectors and strategies for cardiovascular gene therapy. Cardiovascular diseases are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in both men and women in industrially developed countries. These disorders may result from impaired angiogenesis, particularly in response to hypoxia. Despite many limitations, gene therapy is still emerging as a potential alternative for patients who are not candidates for traditional revascularization procedures, like angioplasty or vein grafts. This review focuses on recent approaches in the development of new gene delivery vectors, with great respect to newly discovered AAV serotypes and their modified forms. Moreover, some new cardiovascular gene therapy strategies have been highlighted, such as combination of different angiogenic growth factors or simultaneous application of genes and progenitor cells in order to obtain stable and functional blood vessels in ischemic tissue. </text>

      <text>Impaired apoptosis of pulmonary endothelial cells is associated with intimal proliferation and irreversibility of pulmonary hypertension in congenital heart disease. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the cellular and histologic basis of irreversible pulmonary hypertension (PHT) in the clinical setting of congenital heart disease (CHD). BACKGROUND: Although many children with CHD develop pulmonary vascular disease, it is unclear why this complication is reversible after complete repair in some cases but irreversible in others. Because failure of endothelial cell apoptosis might lead to intimal proliferation and lack of reversibility of PHT, we investigated this and other key markers of vasoactivity and angiogenesis in subjects with PHT and CHD. METHODS: We assessed antiapoptotic and proapoptotic markers in vascular and perivascular cells in lung biopsy samples from 18 patients with CHD, 7 with reversible and 11 with irreversible PHT, and 6 control patients. Immunostaining for endothelial nitric oxide synthase, vascular endothelial growth factor, and CD34 (markers of vasoactivity and neoangiogenesis) was also performed. RESULTS: The antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was highly expressed by pulmonary endothelial cells in all cases of irreversible PHT but in no cases of reversible PHT, nor in control patients (p  less than  0.001). Intimal proliferation was present in 10 of 11 irreversible PHT cases, but never observed in reversible PHT (p  less than  0.001). Similarly, perivascular inflammatory T-cells expressed more antiapoptotic proteins in irreversible PHT (p  less than  0.01). Irreversible PHT cases were also more likely to show compensatory upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor and new small vessel formation at the sites of native vessel stenosis or occlusion (p  less than  0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Irreversible PHT is strongly associated with impaired endothelial cell apoptosis and antiapoptotic signaling from perivascular inflammatory cells. These changes are associated with intimal proliferation and vessel narrowing, and thereby may contribute to clinical outcomes associated with pulmonary hypertension. </text>

      <text>Inhibition of Dll4-mediated signaling induces proliferation of immature vessels and results in poor tissue perfusion. Vascular development is dependent on various growth factors and certain modifiers critical for providing arterial or venous identity, interaction with the surrounding stroma and tissues, hierarchic network formation, and recruitment of pericytes. Notch receptors and ligands (Jagged and Delta-like) play a critical role in this process in addition to VEGF. Dll4 is one of the Notch ligands that regulates arterial specification and maturation events. In the current study, we have shown that loss of function by either targeted allele deletion or use of a soluble form of Dll4 extracellular domain leads to inhibition of Notch signaling, resulting in increased vascular proliferation but defective maturation. Newly forming vessels have thin caliber, a markedly reduced vessel lumen, markedly reduced pericyte recruitment, and deficient vascular perfusion. sDll4 similarly induced defective vascular response in tumor implants leading to reduced tumor growth. Interference with Dll4-Notch signaling may be particularly desirable in tumors that have highly induced Dll4-Notch pathway. </text>

      <text>SWAP-70 is required for oncogenic transformation by v-Src in mouse embryo fibroblasts.  SWAP-70 is a phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)) binding protein, which acts in F-actin rearrangement. The role of SWAP-70 in oncogenic transformation of mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) by v-Src was examined by use of MEFs defective in SWAP-70. v-Src morphologically transformed MEFs lacking SWAP-70, but growth of the transformed cells in culture was slower than that of cells supplemented with exogenous SWAP-70. The v-Src-transformed MEFs deficient in SWAP-70 were unable to grow in soft agar while those expressing SWAP70 readily formed colonies, suggesting that SWAP-70 is required for anchorage independent growth of v-Src transformed MEFs. When transplanted in nude mice, tumors formed by the v-Src transformed SWAP-70(-/-) MEFs were smaller than those formed by cells expressing exogenous SWAP-70. These results suggest that SWAP-70 may be required for oncogenic transformation and contributes to cell growth in MEFs transformed by v-Src. </text>

      <text>Tsg101 is upregulated in a subset of invasive human breast cancers and its targeted overexpression in transgenic mice reveals weak oncogenic properties for mammary cancer initiation.  Previous studies reported that the Tumor Susceptibility Gene 101 (TSG101) is upregulated in selected human malignancies, and the expression of exogenous Tsg101 was suggested to transform immortalized fibroblasts in culture. To date, the potential oncogenic properties of Tsg101 have not been examined in vivo owing to the lack of appropriate model systems. In this study, we show that Tsg101 is highly expressed in a subset of invasive human breast cancers. Based on this observation, we generated the first transgenic mouse model with a targeted overexpression of Tsg101 in the developing mammary gland to test whether exogenous Tsg101 is capable of initiating tumorigenesis. Normal functionality of exogenous Tsg101 was tested by rescuing the survival of Tsg101-deficient mammary epithelial cells in conditional knockout mice. The overexpression of Tsg101 resulted in increased phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor and downstream activation of MAP kinases. Despite an increase in the activation of these signal transducers, the mammary gland of females expressing exogenous Tsg101 developed normally throughout the reproductive cycle. In aging females, the overexpression of Tsg101 seemed to increase the susceptibility of mammary epithelia toward malignant transformation. However, owing to the long latency of tumor formation and the sporadic occurrence of bona fide mammary cancers, we conclude that the Tsg101 protein has only weak oncogenic properties. Instead of cancer initiation, it is therefore likely that Tsg101 plays a more predominant role in the progression of a subset of spontaneously arising breast cancers. </text>

      <text>Expression of Bcl-xL, Bax, and p53 in primary tumors and lymph node metastases in oral squamous cell carcinoma.  Disturbances in expression of apoptosis-associated proteins take part in the development and progression of many human malignancies. The aim of this study was the assessment of correlations among proteins involved in apoptosis-Bcl-xL, Bax, and p53-as well as relationships of these proteins with selected clinicopathological features in oral squamous cell carcinoma. Consequently, we examined by immunohistochemistry, using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase method, Bcl-xL, Bax, and p53 expression in 56 samples of primary oral squamous cell carcinoma and in 22 matched pairs of primary and metastatic tumors. The evaluation of immunostaining of Bcl-xL, Bax, and p53 was analyzed in 10 different tumor fields, and the mean percentage of tumor cells with positive staining was evaluated. The significance of the associations was determined using Spearman correlation analysis and the chi-square test. We found positive Bcl-xL, Bax, and p53 immunostaining in 44.6%, 28.6%, and 58.9% of the studied primary tumors and in 63.6%, 45.5%, and 72.7% of lymph node metastases, respectively. Analysis of associations among studied proteins revealed positive correlation between Bcl-xL and Bax in primary tumors (P&lt;0.03, r=0.307). Statistically significant relationship between p53 expression in primary oral cancers and its expression in lymph node metastases (P&lt;0.02) as well as increased expression of Bcl-xL, Bax, and p53 in metastatic sites compared with primary tumors could indicate an association of these proteins with oral cancer progression and development of metastases. Moreover, we suppose that knowledge about heterogeneity between primary and metastatic tumor might help to understand mechanisms of oral cancer progression. </text>

      <text>The relationship between brain activity and peak grip force is modulated by corticospinal system integrity after subcortical stroke. In healthy human subjects, the relative contribution of cortical regions to motor performance varies with the task parameters. Additionally, after stroke, recruitment of cortical areas during a simple motor task varies with corticospinal system integrity. We investigated whether the pattern of motor system recruitment in a task involving increasingly forceful hand grips is influenced by the degree of corticospinal system damage. Nine chronic subcortical stroke patients and nine age-matched controls underwent functional magnetic brain imaging whilst performing repetitive isometric hand grips. Target grip forces were varied between 15% and 45% of individual maximum grip force. Corticospinal system functional integrity was assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation. Averaged across all forces, there was more task-related activation compared with rest in the secondary motor areas of patients with greater corticospinal system damage, confirming previous reports. However, here we were primarily interested in regional brain activation, which covaried with the amount of force generated, implying a prominent executive role in force production. We found that in control subjects and patients with lesser corticospinal system damage, signal change increased linearly with increasing force output in contralateral primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area and ipsilateral cerebellum. In contrast, in patients with greater corticospinal system damage, force-related signal changes were seen mainly in contralesional dorsolateral premotor cortex, bilateral ventrolateral premotor cortices and contralesional cerebellum, but not ipsilesional primary motor cortex. These findings suggest that the premotor cortices might play a new and functionally relevant role in controlling force production in patients with more severe corticospinal system disruption. </text>

      <text>An antibody directed against PDGF receptor beta enhances the antitumor and the anti-angiogenic activities of an anti-VEGF receptor 2 antibody. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and its receptors (PDGFR) play important roles in tumorigenesis through stimulating tumor growth and promoting angiogenesis via enhancing pericyte recruitment and vessel maturation. Here we produced a neutralizing antibody, 1B3, directed against mouse PDGFRbeta. 1B3 binds to PDGFRbeta with high affinity (9x10(-11)M) and blocks PDGF-BB from binding to the receptor with an IC(50) of approximately 1.2 nM. The antibody also blocks ligand-stimulated activation of PDGFRbeta and downstream signaling molecules, including Akt and MAPK p42/44, in tumor cells. In animal studies, 1B3 significantly enhanced the antitumor and the anti-angiogenic activities of DC101, an antibody directed against mouse vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, in a pancreatic (BxPC-3) and a non-small cell lung (NCI-H460) tumor xenograft models. Treatment with the combination of 1B3 and DC101 in BxPC-3 xenograft-bearing mice resulted in tumor regression in 58% of mice compared to that in 18% of mice treated with DC101 alone. Taken together, these results lend great support to use PDGFRbeta antagonists in combinations with other antitumor and/or anti-angiogenic agents in the treatment of a variety of cancers. </text>

      <text>In vivo p53 response and immune reaction underlie highly effective low-dose radiotherapy in follicular lymphoma.  Very low-dose irradiation (2 x 2 Gy) is a new, effective, and safe local treatment for follicular lymphoma. To understand the biologic mechanisms of this extremely effective response, we compared by microarray the gene-expression profile of patients' biopsies taken before and after radiation. In all patients, a major and consistent induction of p53 target genes was seen. p53 targets involved in cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis showed the same mode of regulation, indicating that, in vivo, both are activated simultaneously. p53 up-regulation and p53-mediated proliferation arrest and apoptosis were substantiated using immunohistochemistry, with activation of both the intrinsic and the extrinsic apoptotic pathways. The other induced genes revealed a whole set of biologically meaningful genes related to macrophage activation and TH1 immune response. Immunohistochemical analysis suggested a specific activation or differentiation of resident macrophages by apoptotic cells. These biologic insights are important arguments to advocate the use of low-dose radiotherapy as an effective palliative treatment for follicular lymphoma. Moreover, this study is the first in vivo report of the radiation-induced p53 apoptotic response in patients and suggests that this apoptotic response is not immunologically silent. </text>

      <text>Caffeine inhibits adenosine-induced accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor, and interleukin-8 expression in hypoxic human colon cancer cells. Frequent coffee consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer in a number of case-control studies. Coffee is a leading source of methylxanthines, such as caffeine. The induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) is an essential feature of tumor angiogenesis, and the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) transcription factor is known to be a key regulator of this process. In this study, we investigated the effects of caffeine on HIF-1 protein accumulation and on VEGF and IL-8 expression in the human colon cancer cell line HT29 under hypoxic conditions. Our results show that caffeine significantly inhibits adenosine-induced HIF-1alpha protein accumulation in cancer cells. We show that HIF-1alpha and VEGF are increased through A3 adenosine receptor stimulation, whereas the effects on IL-8 are mediated via the A2B subtype. Pretreatment of cells with caffeine significantly reduces adenosine-induced VEGF promoter activity and VEGF and IL-8 expression. The mechanism of caffeine seems to involve the inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), p38, and Akt, leading to a marked decrease in adenosine-induced HIF-1alpha accumulation, VEGF transcriptional activation, and VEGF and IL-8 protein accumulation. From a functional perspective, we observe that caffeine also significantly inhibits the A3 receptor-stimulated cell migration of colon cancer cells. Conditioned media prepared from colon cells treated with an adenosine analog increased human umbilical vein endothelial cell migration. These data provide evidence that adenosine could modulate the migration of colon cancer cells by an HIF-1alpha/VEGF/IL-8-dependent mechanism and that caffeine has the potential to inhibit colon cancer cell growth. </text>

      <text>Stress and psychological distress among SARS survivors 1 year after the outbreak. OBJECTIVE: Our study examined the stress level and psychological distress of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) survivors 1 year after the outbreak. METHOD: During the SARS outbreak in 2003, we used the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) to assess SARS survivors treated in 2 major hospitals (non-health care workers, n = 49; health care workers, n = 30). We invited SARS survivors from the same hospitals (non-health care workers, n = 63; health care workers, n = 33) to complete the PSS-10 again in 2004. At that time, they were also asked to complete the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and measures of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic symptoms. PSS-10 scores were also obtained from matched community control subjects during the outbreak (n = 145) and again in 2004 (n = 112). RESULTS: SARS survivors had higher stress levels during the outbreak, compared with control subjects (PSS-10 scores = 19.8 and 17.9, respectively; P &lt; 0.01), and this persisted 1 year later (PSS-10 scores = 19.9 and 17.3, respectively; P &lt; 0.01) without signs of decrease. In 2004, SARS survivors also showed worrying levels of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic symptoms. An alarming proportion (64%) scored above the GHQ-12 cut-off that suggests psychiatric morbidity. During the outbreak, health care worker SARS survivors had stress levels similar to those of non-health care workers, but health care workers showed significantly higher stress levels in 2004 (PSS-10 score = 22.8, compared with PSS-10 score = 18.4; P &lt; 0.05) and had higher depression, anxiety, posttraumatic symptoms, and GHQ-12 scores. CONCLUSIONS: One year after the outbreak, SARS survivors still had elevated stress levels and worrying levels of psychological distress. The situation of health care worker SARS survivors is particularly worrying. The long-term psychological implications of infectious diseases should not be ignored. Mental health services could play an important role in rehabilitation. </text>

      <text>Characterization of transferrin glycoforms in human serum by CE-UV and CE-ESI-MS. Human transferrin (Tf) is a model glycoprotein for congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) diagnosis. In the last few years, new CE-UV methods for intact Tf glycoforms analysis have been developed using nonvolatile BGEs and organic modifiers. However, the use of these BGEs does not allow the coupling of these procedures with electrospray MS (ESI-MS). In this study, a new CE-UV separation method of Tf glycoforms is developed, using a double-layer stable coating and a volatile BGE based on ammonium acetate. The separation method is optimized using standard Tf and their potential is demonstrated applying the method to the analysis of sera Tf from healthy individuals and CDG patients. The CE-UV separation method has been coupled to ESI-MS detection. Main parameters such as sheath liquid composition are optimized in order to obtain a good sensitivity. The CE-ESI-MS method has also been used in serum samples obtaining the separation of the different proteins present in serum and partial separation of Tf glycoforms. Different mass spectra and deconvoluted molecular masses were obtained for each sialoform, allowing unequivocal glycoform identification. </text>

      <text>Medical therapy for intermittent claudication. Medical therapy to improve symptoms, stabilise the underlying vascular disease and improve lower limb outcomes is an important and effective adjunct to lifestyle modification and surgical or endovascular interventions in patients with IC. Randomised placebo controlled trials have shown that the phosphodiesterase III inhibitor cilostazol 100mg bid improves pain-free and maximum walking distance, as well as quality of life, in a range of patients with intermittent claudication in whom there is no evidence of tissue necrosis or rest pain. This review summarises the evidence from 8 pivotal trials of cilostazol involving over 2000 patients with intermittent claudication treated for up to 6 months. There is comparatively less evidence to support the use of other treatment modalities for relief of symptoms in intermittent claudication, but there is considerable interest in therapeutic angiogenesis to promote new vessel formation and enhance collateralisation of the lower limb using recombinant growth factor proteins or gene transfer strategies. The rationale for therapeutic angiogenesis is discussed, together with the most recent results from randomised trials in patients with peripheral arterial disease. </text>

      <text>Modulating metastasis by a lymphangiogenic switch in prostate cancer.  Prostate cancer dissemination is difficult to detect in the clinic, and few treatment options exist for patients with advanced-stage disease. Our aim was to investigate the role of tumor lymphangiogenesis during metastasis. Further, we implemented a noninvasive molecular imaging technique to facilitate the assessment of the metastatic process. The metastatic potentials of several human prostate cancer xenograft models, LAPC-4, LAPC-9, PC3 and CWR22Rv-1 were compared. The cells were labeled with luciferase, a bioluminescence imaging reporter gene, to enable optical imaging. After tumor implantation the animals were examined weekly during several months for the appearance of metastases. Metastatic lesions were confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Additionally, the angiogenic and lymphangiogenic profiles of the tumors were characterized. To confirm the role of lymphangiogenesis in mediating metastasis, the low-metastatic LAPC-9 tumor cells were engineered to overexpress VEGF-C, and the development of metastases was evaluated. Our results show CWR22Rv-1 and PC3 tumor cell lines to be more metastatic than LAPC-4, which in turn disseminates more readily than LAPC-9. The difference in metastatic potential correlated with the endogenous production levels of lymphangiogenic growth factor VEGF-C and the presence of tumor lymphatics. In agreement, induced overexpression of VEGF-C in LAPC-9 enhanced tumor lymphangiogenesis leading to the development of metastatic lesions. Taken together, our studies, based on a molecular imaging approach for semiquantitative detection of micrometastases, point to an important role of tumor lymphatics in the metastatic process of human prostate cancer. In particular, VEGF-C seems to play a key role in prostate cancer metastasis. </text>

      <text>Selective activation of mast cells in rheumatoid synovial tissue results in production of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-1Ra. OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN: To study the consequences of mast cell activation in human synovial tissue. METHODS: Synovial tissue was obtained from 18 RA patients and mast cells was selectively activated in synovial tissue explant cultures. Expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-1Ra were determined and tissue distribution of IL-1beta was studied. RESULTS: Compared to untreated synovia, selective activation of synovial mast cells increased significantly the production of TNF-alpha (0.49 +/- 0.88 vs. 4.56 +/- 3.18 pg/mg wet tissue, p &lt; 0.001) and IL-1beta (0.058 +/- 0.032 vs. 2.55 +/- 1.98 pg/mg wet tissue, p = 0.013). The expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta mRNA increased significantly (19-fold (p = 0.009) and 13-fold (p = 0.031), respectively). Mast cell activation induced IL-1beta expression in particular in nearby CD68 positive synovial macrophages. Secretion of IL-1Ra was also increased but to a lesser degree than that of IL-1beta. CONCLUSIONS: Synovial mast cells produce proinflammmatory cytokines and may thus contribute to the inflammation in RA. </text>

      <text>An assay to measure angiogenesis in human fat tissue. BACKGROUND: Inhibition of angiogenesis reverses rodent obesity. A validated assay in human fat tissue is needed to study the role of angiogenesis in human obesity. METHODS: Human fat tissue fragments from surgery were placed in 96-well plates, embedded in fibrin thrombin clot and overlaid with cell culture media containing 20% fetal bovine serum. After 15 days, the clots were examined by histology and electron microscopy. The effect of taxol, cobalt chloride and a heparin-steroid combination was tested in the fat tissue assay and compared to the validated human placental vein angiogenesis model (HPVAM). RESULTS: Blood vessels initiated growth and elongated from the fat tissue fragments over 15 days. Presence of blood vessels was confirmed with histology and electron microscopy. Taxol at 10(-6) and 10(-7) M completely inhibited angiogenesis, while Taxol 10(-8) and 10(-9) M and the heparin-steroid partially inhibited angiogenesis. The response to taxol and heparin-steroid was similar to that of the HPVAM, a validated angiogenesis assay. Cobalt chloride, a stimulator of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) stimulated angiogenesis initiation at 10(-9) M in fat tissue and the HPVAM, but at 10(-10) M blood vessel growth was stimulated only in the fat assay. CONCLUSION: This angiogenesis assay based on human fat tissue uses three-dimensionally intact human tissue. The vessels are derived from quiescient vessels within the fat. These properties allow the angiogenic switch to be evaluated in an in vitro setting. The angiogenic response of fat tissue is not identical to placental tissue. This assay allows exploration of angiogenesis in fat tissue. </text>

      <text>Rapid mixing between old and new C pools in the canopy of mature forest trees. Stable C isotope signals in plant tissues became a key tool in explaining growth responses to the environment. The technique is based on the fundamental assumption that the isotopic composition of a given unit of tissue (e.g. a tree ring) reflects the specific C uptake conditions in the leaf at a given time. Beyond the methodological implications of any deviation from this assumption, it is of physiological interest whether new C is transferred directly from sources (a photosynthesizing leaf) to structural sinks (e.g. adjacent stem tissue), or inherently passes through existing (mobile) C pools, which may be of variable (older) age. Here, we explore the fate of (13)C-labelled photosynthates in the crowns of a 30-35 m tall, mixed forest using a canopy crane. In all nine study species labelled C reached woody tissue within 2-9 h after labelling. Four months later, very small signals were left in branch wood of Tilia suggesting that low mixing of new, labelled C with old C had taken place. In contrast, signals in Fagus and Quercus had increased, indicating more intense mixing. This species-specific mixing of new with old C pools is likely to mask year- or season-specific linkages between tree ring formation and climate and has considerable implications for climate reconstruction using stable isotopes as proxies for past climatic conditions. </text>

      <text>Subcellular localisation of BAG-1 and its regulation of vitamin D receptor-mediated transactivation and involucrin expression in oral keratinocytes: implications for oral carcinogenesis.  In oral cancers, cytoplasmic BAG-1 overexpression is a marker of poor prognosis. BAG-1 regulates cellular growth, differentiation and survival through interactions with diverse proteins, including the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a key regulator of keratinocyte growth and differentiation. BAG-1 is expressed ubiquitously in human cells as three major isoforms of 50 kDa (BAG-1L), 46 kDa (BAG-1M) and 36 kDa (BAG-1S) from a single mRNA. In oral keratinocytes BAG-1L, but not BAG-1M and BAG-1S, enhanced VDR transactivation in response to 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. BAG-1L was nucleoplasmic and nucleolar, whereas BAG-1S and BAG-1M were cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic in localisation. Having identified the nucleolar localisation sequence in BAG-1L, we showed that mutation of this sequence did not prevent BAG-1L from potentiating VDR activity. BAG-1L also potentiated transactivation of known vitamin-D-responsive gene promoters, osteocalcin and 24-hydroxylase, and enhanced VDR-dependent transcription and protein expression of the keratinocyte differentiation marker, involucrin. These results demonstrate endogenous gene regulation by BAG-1L by potentiating nuclear hormone receptor function and suggest a role for BAG-1L in 24-hydroxylase regulation of vitamin D metabolism and the cellular response of oral keratinocytes to 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. By contrast to the cytoplasmic BAG-1 isoforms, BAG-1L may act to suppress tumorigenesis. </text>

      <text>Transporters, enzymes, and enalapril removal in a rat (CC531-induced) liver metastatic model.  Temporal changes in physiological spaces, protein expression of transporters and enzymes, and enalapril removal were appraised in the metastatic liver tumor model developed from male Wag/Rij rats after the intraportal injection of CC531 colon adenocarcinoma cells; sham-operated preparations received PBS. Liver tissue spaces, investigated with multiple indicator dilution technique in liver perfusion studies, were unchanged at week 3 after tumor induction. At week 4, however, the sinusoidal blood volume and albumin Disse space in tumor-bearing livers were slightly lower compared with those of shams. Increased levels of the canalicular ATP transporters, P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2), and bile salt export pump (Bsep) at week 2 (P &lt; 0.05), unchanged levels of Ntcp, Oatp1a1, Oatp1a4, and Mct2, but decreased levels of cytochrome P450 3a2 (Cyp3a2) and glutathione S-transferase (Gst4-4) at week 4 (P &lt; 0.05) were observed in peritumor vs. sham-operated liver tissues with Western blotting. The steady-state extraction ratio of enalapril, a substrate that enters the liver rapidly via Oatp1a1 and primarily undergoes metabolism by the carboxylesterases, was unaffected by liver metastasis at week 4 regardless of its delivery via the portal vein or hepatic artery into the perfused liver preparations. </text>

      <text>Wnt signaling, stem cells, and the cellular origin of breast cancer.  The breast epithelium comprises cells at different stages of differentiation, including stem cells, progenitor cells, and more differentiated epithelial and myoepithelial cells. Wnt signaling plays a critical role in regulating stem/progenitor cells in the mammary gland as well as other tissue compartments. Furthermore, there is strong evidence suggesting that aberrant activation of Wnt signaling induces mammary tumors from stem/progenitor cells, and that Wnt exerts its oncogenic effects through LRP5/6-mediated activation of beta-catenin and mTOR pathways. Recent studies using avian retrovirus-mediated introduction of oncogenes into a small subset of somatic mammary cells suggest that polyoma middle T antigen (PyMT) may also preferentially transform stem/progenitor cells. These observations suggest that stem/progenitor cells in the mammary gland may be especially susceptible to oncogenic transformation. Whether more differentiated cells may also be transformed by particular oncogenes is actively debated; it is presently unclear whether stem cells or differentiated mammary cells are more susceptible to transformation by individual oncogenes. Better stem cell and progenitor cell markers as well as the ability to specifically target oncogenes into different mammary cell types will be needed to determine the spectrum of oncogene transformation for stem cells versus more differentiated cells. </text>

      <text>Ovarian cancers overexpress the antimicrobial protein hCAP-18 and its derivative LL-37 increases ovarian cancer cell proliferation and invasion. The role of the pro-inflammatory peptide, LL-37, and its pro-form, human cationic antimicrobial protein 18 (hCAP-18), in cancer development and progression is poorly understood. In damaged and inflamed tissue, LL-37 functions as a chemoattractant, mitogen and pro-angiogenic factor suggesting that the peptide may potentiate tumor progression. The aim of this study was to characterize the distribution of hCAP-18/LL-37 in normal and cancerous ovarian tissue and to examine the effects of LL-37 on ovarian cancer cells. Expression of hCAP-18/LL-37 was localized to immune and granulosa cells of normal ovarian tissue. By contrast, ovarian tumors displayed significantly higher levels of hCAP-18/LL-37 where expression was observed in tumor and stromal cells. Protein expression was statistically compared to the degree of immune cell infiltration and microvessel density in epithelial-derived ovarian tumors and a significant correlation was observed for both. It was demonstrated that ovarian tumor tissue lysates and ovarian cancer cell lines express hCAP-18/LL-37. Treatment of ovarian cancer cell lines with recombinant LL-37 stimulated proliferation, chemotaxis, invasion and matrix metalloproteinase expression. These data demonstrate for the first time that hCAP-18/LL-37 is significantly overexpressed in ovarian tumors and suggest LL-37 may contribute to ovarian tumorigenesis through direct stimulation of tumor cells, initiation of angiogenesis and recruitment of immune cells. These data provide further evidence of the existing relationship between pro-inflammatory molecules and ovarian cancer progression. </text>

      <text>Role of telomeres in vascular senescence. Telomeres are DNA regions composed of TTAGGG repeats that are located at the ends of chromosomes. Specific proteins associate with the telomeres and form non-nucleosomal DNA-protein complexes that serve as protective caps for the chromosome ends. There is accumulating evidence that progressive telomere shortening is closely related to cardiovascular disease. For example, vascular cell senescence has been reported to occur in human atherosclerotic lesions and this change is associated with telomere shortening. Impairment of telomere integrity causes vascular dysfunction, which is prevented by the activation of telomerase. Mice with short telomeres develop hypertension and exhibit impaired neovascularization. Short telomeres have also been reported in the leukocytes of patients with cardiovascular disease or various cardiovascular risk factors. Although it remains unclear whether short telomeres directly cause cardiovascular disease, manipulation of telomere function is potentially an attractive strategy for the treatment of vascular senescence. </text>

      <text>M. leprae- and BCG-induced chemiluminescence response of monocytes from leprosy patients and healthy subjects: effects of gamma-interferon and GM-CSF. Mycobacterium leprae, in contrast to BCG, failed to trigger any chemiluminescence (CL) response in mononuclear cells from either leprosy patients or healthy subjects, a deficit not reversed by either interferon-gamma or GM-CSF. Chemiluminescence responses induced without mycobacteria or with BCG were found to be lower in leprosy patients than in controls. M. leprae were also less well phagocytosed than BCG. However, there was a significant difference in phagocytosis between healthy and tuberculoid leprosy subjects. Phagocytosis was not altered by the addition of either lymphokine, and no major differences between healthy subjects and patients were observed. Preincubating mononuclear cells with anti-mycobacteria antibodies (lepromatous patients' sera) did not increase the CL response nor the phagocytosis of M. leprae or BCG. </text>

      <text>Tumor microenvironment, a dangerous society leading to cancer metastasis. From mechanisms to therapy and prevention. Cancer is no longer considered by scientists just a jumble of mutated cells. To grow, invade and metastasize, a treacherous society between cancer and host cells must be formed, and this association provides novel and effective clinical targets for cancer control and prevention. This collection of reviews at the front-edge of scientific knowledge focuses on host-tumor cell interactions, the disastrous consequences they can produce and approaches the ways to break up these cellular conspiracies, to leave the tumor cells unattended and vulnerable. </text>

      <text>[Photodynamic therapy in severe chronic central serous chorioretinopaty] OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) in chronic Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC). METHODS: Patients diagnosed with chronic CSC, with clinical evidence of activity and treated with Photodynamic Therapy, are included in this report. All were assessed by a complete ophthalmological examination, including assessment of the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) using an ETDRS chart, fluorescein and indocyanine angiography and optical coherence tomography (OCT). The main objective of the study was to determine the mean visual acuity change. RESULTS: 11 eyes of 11 patients were included in the study, which had a mean follow-up period of 11 months. The mean BCVA increased from 20/76 to 20/64. 35% of eyes improved their BCVA by 2 lines or more, 45% remained stable and 18% lost 2 lines or more. Choroidal hyperpermeability was reduced in every case. Neurosensorial retinal detachment decreased in 80% of cases. Only one eye received a second PDT treatment due to choroidal neovascularization. An increase of atrophy over the Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) was observed in another patient. CONCLUSIONS: PDT can reduce the clinical signs of activity, such as choroidal hyperpermeability or neurosensorial retinal detachment, in patients affected by chronic CSC. However, the increase in visual acuity is variable, probably due to the extent of RPE damage. </text>

      <text>Angiopoietin-1 prevents VEGF-induced endothelial permeability by sequestering Src through mDia. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Angiopoietin 1 (Ang1) are both potent proangiogenic factors, but, whereas VEGF causes vascular permeability, Ang1 stabilizes blood vessels and protects them from VEGF-induced plasma leakage. The antivascular permeability mechanisms deployed by Ang1 are still undefined. Here, we demonstrate that Ang1 halts the ability of VEGF to induce the phosphorylation-dependent redistribution of the adhesion molecule VE-cadherin, thereby rescuing the endothelial barrier function. Ang1 inhibits the activation of Src by VEGF, the most upstream component of the pathway linking VEGF receptors to VE-cadherin internalization. Indeed, Ang1 promotes the activation of mDia through RhoA, resulting in the association of mDia with Src. This ultimately deprives VEGF receptors of an essential molecule required for promoting the disruption of endothelial cell-cell contacts and paracellular permeability. </text>

      <text>RUNX1 DNA-binding mutations and RUNX1-PRDM16 cryptic fusions in BCR-ABL+ leukemias are frequently associated with secondary trisomy 21 and may contribute to clonal evolution and imatinib resistance.  Acquired molecular abnormalities (mutations or chromosomal translocations) of the RUNX1 transcription factor gene are frequent in acute myeloblastic leukemias (AMLs) and in therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes, but rarely in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs) and chronic myelogenous leukemias (CMLs). Among 18 BCR-ABL+ leukemias presenting acquired trisomy of chromosome 21, we report a high frequency (33%) of recurrent point mutations (4 in myeloid blast crisis [BC] CML and one in chronic phase CML) within the DNA-binding region of RUNX1. We did not found any mutation in de novo BCR-ABL+ ALLs or lymphoid BC CML. Emergence of the RUNX1 mutations was detected at diagnosis or before the acquisition of trisomy 21 during disease progression. In addition, we also report a high frequency of cryptic chromosomal RUNX1 translocation to a novel recently described gene partner, PRDM16 on chromosome 1p36, for 3 (21.4%) of 14 investigated patients: 2 myeloid BC CMLs and, for the first time, 1 therapy-related BCR-ABL+ ALL. Two patients presented both RUNX1 mutations and RUNX1-PRDM16 fusion. These events are associated with a short survival and support the concept of a cooperative effect of BCR-ABL with molecular RUNX1 abnormalities on the differentiation arrest phenotype observed during progression of CML and in BCR-ABL+ ALL. </text>

      <text>Suppression of lung tumor growth and metastasis in mice by adeno-associated virus-mediated expression of vasostatin. PURPOSE: Angiogenesis inhibitors have strong therapeutic potential as antitumor agents in suppressing tumor growth and metastatic progression. Vasostatin, the N-terminal domain of calreticulin, is a potent angiogenesis inhibitor. In this study, we determined the effectiveness of vasostatin delivered by recombinant pseudotype adeno-associated virus 2/5 (rAAV2/5-VAS) as a gene therapy approach for lung cancer treatment. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used rAAV2/5 to deliver vasostatin intratumorally or systemically in different mouse lung tumor models--subcutaneous, orthotopic xenograft, and spontaneous metastasis lung tumor models. The therapeutic efficacy of rAAV2/5-VAS was determined by monitoring tumor volume, survival rate, and degree of neovascularization after treatment in these models. RESULTS: Mice bearing subcutaneous tumor of rAAV2/5-VAS pretreated Lewis lung carcinoma cells showed &gt;50% reduction in primary tumor volume and reduced spontaneous pulmonary metastases. The tumor-suppressive action of rAAV2/5-VAS in subcutaneous human lung tumor A549 xenograft correlated with a reduced number of capillary vessels in tumors. In the orthotopic xenograft model, rAAV2/5-VAS suppressed metastasis of A549 tumors to mediastinal lymph nodes and contralateral lung. Furthermore, treatment of immunocompetent mice in the spontaneous lung metastases model with rAAV2/5-VAS after primary tumor excision prolonged their median survival from 21 to 51.5 days. CONCLUSION: Our results show the effectiveness of rAAV2/5-VAS as an angiogenesis inhibitor in suppressing tumor growth during different stages of tumor progression, validating the application of rAAV2/5-VAS gene therapy in treatment against lung cancer. </text>

      <text>Radiation retinopathy is treatable with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor bevacizumab (Avastin). PURPOSE: To report on bevacizumab treatment for radiation retinopathy affecting the macula. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients with radiation retinopathy (edema, hemorrhages, capillary dropout, and neovascularization) and a subjective or objective loss of vision were treated. Treatment involved intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (1.25 mg in 0.05 mL) every 6-12 weeks. Treatment was discontinued at patient request or if there was no measurable response to therapy. Main outcome measures included best corrected visual acuity, ophthalmic examination, retinal photography, and angiography. RESULTS: Bevacizumab treatment was followed by reductions in retinal hemorrhage, exudation, and edema. Visual acuities were stable or improved in 86% (n=18). Three patients discontinued therapy. Each was legally blind before treatment (n=1), experienced little to no subjective improvement (n=2), or was poorly compliant (n=2). Three patients (14%) regained 2 or more lines of visual acuity. No ocular or systemic bevacizumab-related side effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal bevacizumab can be used to treat radiation retinopathy. In most cases treatment was associated with decreased vascular leakage, stabilization, or improved vision. An anti-vascular endothelial growth factor strategy may reduce tissue damage associated with radiation vasculopathy and neuropathy. </text>

      <text>Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase signaling promotes growth and vascularization of fibrosarcoma. We hypothesized that signaling through multiple mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MKK) pathways is essential for the growth and vascularization of soft-tissue sarcomas, which are malignant tumors derived from mesenchymal tissues. We tested this using HT-1080, NCI, and Shac fibrosarcoma-derived cell lines and anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx), a bacterial toxin that inactivates MKKs. Western blots confirmed that LeTx treatment reduced the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 MAPK in vitro. Although short treatments with LeTx only modestly affected cell proliferation, sustained treatment markedly reduced cell numbers. LeTx also substantially inhibited the extracellular release of angioproliferative factors including vascular endothelial growth factor, interleukin-8, and basic fibroblast growth factor. Similar results were obtained with cell lines derived from malignant fibrous histiocytomas, leiomyosarcomas, and liposarcomas. In vivo, LeTx decreased MAPK activity and blocked fibrosarcoma growth. Growth inhibition correlated with decreased cellular proliferation and extensive necrosis, and it was accompanied by a decrease in tumor mean vessel density as well as a reduction in serum expression of angioproliferative cytokines. Vital imaging using high-resolution ultrasound enhanced with contrast microbubbles revealed that the effects of LeTx on tumor perfusion were remarkably rapid ( less than 24 h) and resulted in a marked reduction of perfusion within the tumor but not in nontumor tissues. These results are consistent with our initial hypothesis and lead us to propose that MKK inhibition by LeTx is a broadly effective strategy for targeting neovascularization in fibrosarcomas and other similar proliferative lesions. </text>

      <text>A novel putative tyrosine kinase receptor with oncogenic potential.  We have detected transforming activity by a tumorigenicity assay using NIH3T3 cells transfected with DNA from a chronic myeloproliferative disorder patient. Here, we report the cDNA cloning of the corresponding oncogene, designated UFO, in allusion to the as yet unidentified function of its protein. Nucleotide sequence analysis of a 3116bp cDNA clone revealed a 2682-bp-long open reading frame capable of directing the synthesis of a 894 amino acid polypeptide. The predicted UFO protein exhibits characteristic features of a transmembrane receptor with associated tyrosine kinase activity. The UFO proto-oncogene maps to human chromosome 19q13.1 and is transcribed into two 5.0 kb and 3.2 kb mRNAs in human bone marrow and human tumor cell lines. The UFO locus is evolutionarily conserved between vertebrate species. A 4.0 kb mRNA of the murine UFO homolog is expressed in a variety of different mouse tissues. We thus have identified a novel element of the complex signaling network involved in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation. </text>

      <text>Proteomic comparison of nasopharyngeal cancer cell lines C666-1 and NP69 identifies down-regulation of annexin II and beta2-tubulin for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.  CONTEXT: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), common in southern China and North Africa, has a complex etiology involving interplay between viral, environmental, and hereditary factors and is almost constantly associated with the Epstein-Barr virus. Since the prognosis of locally advanced and metastatic diseases is poor, increased understanding of the pathogenesis of NPC would be important for discovering novel markers for patients' management. OBJECTIVES: To compare the proteomic expression profile between an Epstein-Barr virus-associated NPC cell line (C666-1) and a normal NP cell line (NP69). The proteins with differential expression were analyzed in 40 undifferentiated NPC paraffin-embedded specimens. DESIGN: Differentially expressed proteins discovered between the two cell lines were identified by mass spectrometry. After confirmation by immunocytochemical staining, their expression in patient samples was measured using 40 pairs of undifferentiated NPCs together with their adjacent normal epithelia. RESULTS: Proteomic findings indicated that adenosine triphosphate synthase alpha chain was up-regulated, whereas annexin II, annexin V, beta(2)-tubulin, and profilin 1 were down-regulated. After confirming the results in agar-processed cell lines, annexin II and beta(2)-tubulin expression were found to be lower in tumor cells than in adjacent normal epithelial cells in 100% and 90% of the patients' specimens, respectively. Finally, annexin II down-regulation was positively associated with lymph node metastasis, suggesting that it may be a prognostic factor in NPC. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that annexin II and beta(2)-tubulin down-regulation is important in NPC formation and may represent potential targets for further investigations. </text>

      <text>A practical interface for microfluidics and nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry. We report a new method for fabricating nanospray ionization tips for MS, formed from glass substrates and the inert polymer, parylene-C. Using a single photolithography step, the emitters are formed contiguously with microchannels, such that no dead volumes are observed. In addition, because the devices are very thin (approximately 0.3 mm) and the tips are formed at rectangular corners, the Taylor cone volumes are small, which makes the method attractive for future integration with microfluidic separations. Device performance was demonstrated by evaluating diverse analytes, ranging from synthetic polymers, to peptides, to nucleic acids. For all analytes, performance was similar to that of conventional emitters (pulled-glass capillaries and the Agilent HPLC Chip) with the advantage of rapid, batch fabrication of identical devices. </text>

      <text>MMTV-cre-mediated fur inactivation concomitant with PLAG1 proto-oncogene activation delays salivary gland tumorigenesis in mice.  Proprotein convertases are serine endoproteases implicated in the proteolytic processing of a large variety of regulatory proteins. An important role of proprotein convertases in tumorigenic processes has been suggested by various studies. In this study, the role of the proprotein convertase furin in PLAG1 proto-oncogene-induced salivary gland tumorigenesis was investigated. PLAG1 overexpression in salivary glands has previously been shown to result in salivary gland tumors in 100% of mice within 5 weeks after birth. MMTV-cre-mediated inactivation of fur without over-expression of PLAG1 caused smaller but histologically normal salivary glands. Moreover, the lymph nodes close to the salivary glands were enlarged, and histology showed that they had activated follicles. When genetic ablation of 1 or 2 alleles of fur and overexpression of the PLAG1 transgene were simultaneously achieved, a significant delay in tumorigenesis was observed. Collectively, these results suggest an important role for furin in PLAG1-induced salivary gland tumorigenesis in mice. </text>

      <text>Isotype-specific inhibitors of the glycolytic key regulator pyruvate kinase subtype M2 moderately decelerate tumor cell proliferation.  Tumor cells express the glycolytic regulator pyruvate kinase subtype M2 (M2-PK), which can occur in a tetrameric form with high affinity to its substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and a dimeric form with a low PEP affinity. The transition between both conformations contributes to the control of glycolysis and is important for tumor cell proliferation and survival. Here we targeted M2-PK by synthetic peptide aptamers, which specifically bind to M2-PK and shift the isoenzyme into its low affinity dimeric conformation. The aptamer-induced dimerization and inactivation of M2-PK led to a significant decrease in the PK mass-action ratio as well as ATP:ADP ratio in the target cells. Furthermore, the expression of M2-PK-binding peptide aptamers moderately reduced the growth of immortalized NIH3T3 cell populations by decelerating cell proliferation, but without affecting apoptotic cell death. Moreover, the M2-PK-binding peptide aptamers also reduced the proliferation rate of human U-2 OS osteosarcoma cells. In the present study, we developed the first specific inhibitors of the pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 and present evidence that these inhibitors moderately decelerate tumor cell proliferation. </text>

      <text>Hematogenous metastasis in gastric cancer requires isolated tumor cells and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1.  PURPOSE: Recent studies of cancer metastasis have focused on the role of premetastatic gene expression and circulating tumor cells. We did a blind prospective study in gastric cancer to assess the significance of isolated tumor cells (ITC) and to test the hypothesis that vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) is expressed within the bone marrow at tumor-specific, premetastatic sites. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Both bone marrow and peripheral blood samples from 810 gastric cancer patients were collected at the Central Hospital, National Cancer Center (Tokyo, Japan). The samples were transferred to Kyushu University Hospital (Beppu, Japan) where they were analyzed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR for three epithelial cell markers, carcinoembryonic antigen, cytokeratin-19, and cytokeratin-7, as well as VEGFR-1. RESULTS: ITCs were observed in peripheral blood and bone marrow even in early stages of gastric cancer. The frequency of ITC in bone marrow was significantly associated with the stage of disease by ANOVA (P &lt; 0.01). Gastric cancer metastasized when ITCs were observed in the presence of VEGFR-1. In the 380 patients who were ITC negative and showed low VEGFR-1 expression, synchronous (at the time of surgery) and heterochronous (recurrent) metastases were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: ITCs circulate even in early stages of disease. Furthermore, elevated expression of VEGFR-1 facilitates the establishment of hematogenous metastases in gastric cancer. This study indicates that the simultaneous presence of ITC and VEGFR-1 expression at premetastatic sites is clinically significant for disease progression. </text>

      <text>Acute ethanol exposure disrupts VEGF receptor cell signaling in endothelial cells. Physiological angiogenesis is regulated by various factors, including signaling through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors. We previously reported that a single dose of ethanol (1.4 g/kg), yielding a blood alcohol concentration of 100 mg/dl, significantly impairs angiogenesis in murine wounds, despite adequate levels of VEGF, suggesting direct effects of ethanol on endothelial cell signaling (40). To examine the mechanism by which ethanol influences angiogenesis in wounds, we employed two different in vitro angiogenesis assays to determine whether acute ethanol exposure (100 mg/dl) would have long-lasting effects on VEGF-induced capillary network formation. Ethanol exposure resulted in reduced VEGF-induced cord formation on collagen and reduced capillary network structure on Matrigel in vitro. In addition, ethanol exposure decreased expression of endothelial VEGF receptor-2, as well as VEGF receptor-2 phosphorylation in vitro. Inhibition of ethanol metabolism by 4-methylpyrazole partially abrogated the effect of ethanol on endothelial cell cord formation. However, mice treated with t-butanol, an alcohol not metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase, exhibited no change in wound vascularity. These results suggest that products of ethanol metabolism are important factors in the development of ethanol-induced changes in endothelial cell responsiveness to VEGF. In vivo, ethanol exposure caused both decreased angiogenesis and increased hypoxia in wounds. Moreover, in vitro experiments demonstrated a direct effect of ethanol on the response to hypoxia in endothelial cells, as ethanol diminished nuclear hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha protein levels. Together, the data establish that acute ethanol exposure significantly impairs angiogenesis and suggest that this effect is mediated by changes in endothelial cell responsiveness to both VEGF and hypoxia. </text>

      <text>Adenomatoid tumour of the liver. An unusual primary adenomatoid tumour arising in the normal liver is described. Hepatectomy was performed, and the patient is alive and free of disease 1 year postsurgery. Grossly, the tumour showed a haemorrhagic cut surface with numerous microcystic structures. Histological examination revealed cystic or angiomatoid spaces of various sizes lined by cuboidal, low-columnar, or flattened epithelioid cells with vacuolated cytoplasm and round to oval nuclei. The epithelioid cells were entirely supported by proliferated capillaries and arteries together with collagenous stroma. Immunohistochemical studies showed that the epithelioid cells were strongly positive for a broad spectrum of cytokeratins (AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, epithelial membrane antigen and cytokeratin 7) and mesothelial markers (calretinin, Wilms' tumour 1 and D2-40). These cells were negative for Hep par-1, carcinoembryonic antigen, neural cell adhesion molecule, CD34, CD31 and HMB45. Atypically, abundant capillaries were observed; however, the cystic proliferation of epithelioid cells with vacuoles and immunohistochemical profile of the epithelioid element were consistent with hepatic adenomatoid tumour. </text>

      <text>Research advances of endostatin and its short internal fragments. Endostatin, the C-terminal fragment of collagen XVIII, is a potent angiogenesis inhibitor. At present, there are a large number of research papers on endostatin. However, the action mechanism of endostatin is still a matter of ongoing discussion. The objective of this review is to elucidate its origin and elementary structure, and to discuss its structure basis of activity and action mechanisms based on the latest research. Furthermore, some published studies reporting the antiangiogenic effects of endostatin-derived peptides were also reviewed. It is proposed that the amino acid sequence of endostatin contains both angiosuppressive and angiostimulatory domains. Short endostatin fragments may be exploited as a new angiogenesis inhibitor for therapeutic applications, in substitution of the full length endostatin. These studies on endostatin fragments also shed light on our understanding of the molecular action mechanisms of endostatin. </text>

      <text>Contemporary perspectives on vital pulp therapy: views from the endodontists and pediatric dentists. The purpose of this study was to determine the level of agreement between pediatric dentists and endodontists at a pulp therapy symposium conjointly sponsored by the American Association of Endodontists (AAE) and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) on November 2-3, 2007. Presymposium and postsymposium tests were administered, and respondent answers were compared between pediatric dentists and endodontists. Opinions on 3 areas were sought: pulp therapy for cariously involved primary teeth; indirect pulp treatment (IPT) for cariously involved immature permanent teeth; and innovative treatment options including pulpal revascularization and regeneration. Results were analyzed with chi2 tests. Comparisons of presymposium and postsymposium responses and between the 2 groups of attendees indicated that the pediatric dentistry and endodontic communities agree that formocresol will be replaced as a primary tooth pulpotomy agent, that mineral trioxide is the first choice to take its place, that IPT in primary teeth holds hope as a replacement for pulpotomy, and that IPT is an acceptable pulp therapy technique for cariously involved young permanent teeth. Both groups believe that pulp revascularization and regeneration will be viable treatment modalities in the future. The AAE and the AAPD are positioned to begin preparation of best practice guidelines that share common language and treatment recommendations for pulp therapies performed by both specialties. </text>

      <text>Intraoperative handling and wound healing of arthroscopic portal wounds: a clinical study comparing nylon suture with wound closure strips. This prospective, single-centre study compared wound closure methods in patients undergoing arthroscopy. Closure of arthroscopic portal wounds with sterile adhesive strips is effective and convenient for wound management. The method was associated with a reduced potential for infection, faster renewal of tensile strength, greater cost effectiveness, and better cosmetic effects comparing with suture closure. This method of wound closure may also reduce the incidence of needle stick injury in the theatre environment. Thereby the incidence of percutaneous exposure following a surgical procedure may not facilitate transmission of blood borne pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus and hepatitis B virus. As a result it may reduce litigation in today's changing healthcare climate. </text>

      <text>The role of platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor/thymidine phosphorylase in tumor behavior. Platelet-derived endothelial cell growth-factor (PD-ECGF) is similar to the pyrimidine enzyme thymidine phosphorylase (TP). A high TP expression at tumor sites is correlated with tumor growth, induction of angiogenesis, and metastasis. Therefore, high TP is most likely associated with a poor prognosis. TP is not only expressed in tumor cells but also in tumor surrounding tissues, such as tumor infiltrating macrophages. TP catalyzes the conversion of thymidine to thymine and doxyribose-1-phosphate (dR-1-P). The latter in its parent form or in its sugar form, deoxyribose (dR) may play a role in the induction of angiogenesis. It may modulate cellular energy metabolism or be a substrate in a chemical reaction generating reactive oxygen species. L-deoxyribose (L-dR) and thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor (TPI) can reverse these effects. The mechanism of TP induction is not yet completely clear, but TNF, IL10 and other cytokines have been clearly shown to induce its expression. The various complex interactions of TP give it an essential role in cellular functioning and, hence, it is an ideal target in cancer therapy. </text>

      <text>Investigation of the effect of kaolin and tissue-factor-activated citrated whole blood, on clot-forming variables, as evaluated by thromboelastography. BACKGROUND: The Thrombelastograph (TEG; Haemoscope Corp.) analyzes clot formation in whole blood (WB) and treatment based on this analysis has been shown to reduce transfusion requirements in liver and cardiac surgery when compared to conventional coagulation analysis. Implementing TEG as a routine laboratory-based analysis, however, requires validation of the activators employed and the effect of storage of the WB sample in citrate before analysis. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The effect of kaolin, tissue factor (TF) 1:17,000, or TF 1:42,500 on TEG clotting time (R), Angle (velocity of clot formation), and maximum clot strength (amplitude [MA]) were evaluated, together with day-to-day variation, the coefficient of variance (CV%), and the effect of citrate storage time. RESULTS: Clot formation variables were equally affected by TF 1:17,000 and kaolin activation, whereas R was significantly longer when TF 1:42,500 was used. The CV for the different variables varied from 3 to 13 percent with no significant differences between assays. Storage of citrated WB significantly affected the TEG variables in a hypercoagulable direction. Only the R, however, was significantly affected (12%) when samples rested for 0 and 30 minutes were evaluated with kaolin as the activator. CONCLUSION: The TEG assays evaluated were reproducible and present with an acceptable CV% for routine clinical practice. Kaolin and TF 1:17,000 equally affected the clot formation variables. Storage of WB for up to 30 minutes in citrate did not, except for R, affect clot formation variables when kaolin was used as activator allowing for immediate analysis when the sample arrives in the laboratory. </text>

      <text>Reversal of the malignant phenotype of ovarian cancer A2780 cells through transfection with wild-type PTEN gene.  OBJECTIVE: PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) is a tumor suppressor gene identified on human chromosome 10q23. Substantial studies have demonstrated that PTEN can inhibit cell proliferation, migration and invasion of many cancer cells. The purpose of this study was to determine whether upregulation of PTEN gene by transfection wild-type PTEN gene to ovarian cancer cells can inhibit growth and migration and to explore the potential for PTEN gene therapy of ovarian cancers. METHOD: Wild-type and phosphatase-inactive (C124A) PTEN plasmids were transfected into ovarian epithelial cancer A2780 cells, and their effects on cell apoptosis, cell proliferation, cell migration and cell invasion were analyzed by flow cytometry analysis, TUNEL assay, MTT assay, wound-healing assay and transwell assay. RESULTS: Both wild-type and mutant PTEN can upregulate the expression of PTEN gene dramatically; however, it is wild-type PTEN not phosphatase-inactive PTEN that can induce apoptosis and decrease cell migration, invasion and proliferation in ovarian cancer cells. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that PTEN had played an important role in the cell proliferation, cell migration and invasion dependent on its phosphatase activity. Enhanced expression of PTEN by gene transfer is sufficient to reverse the malignant phenotype of ovarian cancer cells and transfection of ovarian cancer cells with wild-type PTEN gene might be another novel approach for therapeutic intervention in ovarian cancer. </text>

      <text>Allogeneic injection of fetal membrane-derived mesenchymal stem cells induces therapeutic angiogenesis in a rat model of hind limb ischemia. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) have been demonstrated to be an attractive therapeutic cell source for tissue regeneration and repair. However, it remains unknown whether or not allogeneic transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) derived from fetal membranes (FM), which are generally discarded as medical waste after delivery, has therapeutic potential. FM-MSC were obtained from Lewis rats and had surface antigen expression and multipotent potential partly similar to those of BM-MSC. Compared with BM-MSC, FM-MSC secreted a comparable amount of hepatocyte growth factor despite a small amount of vascular endothelial growth factor. FM-MSC and BM-MSC both expressed major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I but not MHC class II antigens and did not elicit allogeneic lymphocyte proliferation in mixed lymphocyte culture. FM-MSC or BM-MSC obtained from Lewis rats were injected into a MHC-mismatched August-Copenhagen-Irish rat model of hind limb ischemia. Three weeks after injection, blood perfusion and capillary density were significantly higher in the FM-MSC and BM-MSC groups than in the phosphate-buffered saline group, and allogeneic FM-MSC and BM-MSC were still observed. In nonischemic hind limb tissues, allogeneic FM-MSC and BM-MSC injection were associated with a comparatively small amount of T lymphocyte infiltration, compared with the injection of allogeneic splenic lymphocytes. In conclusion, allogeneic FM-MSC injection did not elicit a lymphocyte proliferative response and provided significant improvement in a rat model of hind limb ischemia, comparable to the response to BM-MSC. Thus, allogeneic injection of FM-MSC may be a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of severe peripheral vascular disease. Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is found at the end of this article. </text>

      <text>Regulation of the Warburg effect in early-passage breast cancer cells.  Malignancy in cancer is associated with aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) evidenced by increased trapping of [(18)F]deoxyglucose (FdG) in patients imaged by positron emission tomography (PET). [(18)F]deoxyglucose uptake correlates with glucose transporter (GLUT-1) expression, which can be regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha). We have previously reported in established breast lines that HIF-1alpha levels in the presence of oxygen leads to the Warburg effect. However, glycolysis and GLUT-1 can also be induced independent of HIF-1alpha by other factors, such as c-Myc and phosphorylated Akt (pAkt). This study investigates HIF-1alpha, c-Myc, pAkt, and aerobic glycolysis in low-passage breast cancer cells under the assumption that these represent the in vivo condition better than established lines. Similar to in vivo FdG-PET or primary breast cancers, rates of glycolysis were diverse, being higher in cells expressing both c-Myc and HIF-1alpha and lower in cell lines low or negative in both transcription factors. No correlations were observed between glycolytic rates and pAkt levels. Two of 12 cell lines formed xenografts in mice. Both were positive for HIF-1alpha and phosphorylated c-Myc, and only one was positive for pAkt. Glycolysis was affected by pharmacological regulation of c-Myc and HIF-1alpha. These findings suggest that c-Myc and/or HIF-1alpha activities are both involved in the regulation of glycolysis in breast cancers. </text>

      <text>Intracerebral grafting of cultured autologous skin fibroblasts into the rat striatum: an assessment of graft size and ultrastructure. To identify a suitable donor cell population for gene therapy applications to the central nervous system, primary fibroblasts isolated from skin biopsies and maintained in culture are employed as autologous cells for intracerebral grafting within the adult rat striatum. Results from the present investigation reveal that cultured primary skin fibroblasts cease to proliferate once they reach confluence; these cells are thus contact inhibited in vitro. Following implantation within the striatum, the volume of the primary fibroblast grafts, stained immunohistochemically for fibronectin, does not differ significantly at 3 and 8 weeks. The graft size is dependent on the density of the cell suspension, but not dependent on either the number of passages the cells are taken through in culture prior to grafting or on the postoperative survival period. Ultrastructural evidence reveals that at 8 weeks the grafts are composed primarily of collagen and fibroblasts with rough endoplasmic reticulum and vesicles. Reactive astrocytic processes and phagocytic cells are also present in the grafts. The grafts are extensively vascularized with capillaries composed of nonfenestrated endothelium; intercellular junctions are evident at sites of apposition between endothelial cells. It is concluded that primary skin fibroblasts are able to survive for at least 8 weeks following intracerebral implantation and continue to synthesize collagen and fibronectin in vivo. Also, the grafts maintain a constant volume between 3 and 8 weeks, thereby indicating that primary skin fibroblasts do not produce tumors. Finally, dynamic host-to-graft interactions--including phagocytic migration, astrocytic hypertrophy and infiltration within the grafts, and angiogenesis--are features that constitute the structural integration of primary skin fibroblasts grafted within the adult rat central nervous system. </text>

      <text>[TESE and mTESE. Therapeutic options in male infertility due to testicular azoospermia]. Modern techniques of testicular sperm extraction (TESE) make it possible for an infertile man to father a child. The operations are standardized to a large extent and the underlying morphological alterations of spermatogenesis also appear to be sufficiently known. Current research is focused on prognostic factors for the testicular material that determine the sperm retrieval rate and success rates after in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF-ICSI).TESE and microTESE are accepted standard operations for testicular sperm retrieval for IVF/ICSI. Predictions for effective sperm recovery are addressed. </text>

      <text>Quantitative retention-biological activity relationship study by micellar liquid chromatography. In a previous paper, the usefulness of micellar liquid chromatography (MLC) in predicting octanol-water partition coefficients of organic compounds was reported. This paper is the first successful report of a quantitative retention-activity relationship study using the retention factor in MLC for predicting the biological activity of a group of phenolic compounds. Excellent correlation was obtained between the capacity factor in MLC and the bioactivity (measured as log 1/C, where C is the 50% inhibitory growth concentration) of 26 para-substituted phenols. A single MLC retention parameter is capable of describing the bioactivity of phenols, while three conventional molecular descriptors (log P(ow), pKa, and R) are needed to achieve a similar correlation. This indicates that both hydrophobic and electronic interactions are incorporated in a single MLC retention parameter, which is due to the amphiphilic nature of surfactants in the system. In situations like this, QRAR is a suitable alternative to QSAR since measuring MLC retention is much easier than measuring different molecular descriptors needed to build the QSAR model. Addition of 10% 2-propanol to a micellar system (hybrid system) proved to be the best chromatographic system for the best estimation of the phenols bioactivity. Other chromatographic factors such as pH and stationary phase also showed significant effect on the correlation between capacity factor k' and log 1/C. </text>

      <text>Thermostability and molecular encapsulation within an engineered caged protein scaffold. Self-assembling biological complexes such as viral capsids have been manipulated to function in innovative nanotechnology applications. The E2 component of pyruvate dehydrogenase from Bacillus stearothermophilus forms a dodecahedral complex and potentially provides another platform for these purposes. In this investigation, we show that this protein assembly exhibits unusual stability and can be modified to encapsulate model drug molecules. To distill the E2 protein down to its structural scaffold core, we synthesized a truncated gene optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. The correct assembly and dodecahedral structure of the resulting scaffold was confirmed with dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Using circular dichroism and differential scanning calorimetry, we found the thermostability of the complex to be unusually high, with an onset temperature of unfolding at 81.1 +/- 0.9 degrees C and an apparent midpoint unfolding temperature of 91.4 +/- 1.4 degrees C. To evaluate the potential of this scaffold for encapsulation of guest molecules, we made variants at residues 381 and 239 which altered the physicochemical properties of the hollow internal cavity. These mutants, yielding 60 and 120 mutations within this cavity, assembled into the correct architecture and exhibited high thermostability that was comparable to the wild-type scaffold. To show the applicability of this scaffold, two different fluorescent dye molecules were covalently coupled to the cysteine mutant at site 381. We demonstrate that these mutations can introduce non-native functionality and enable molecular encapsulation within the cavity while still retaining the dodecahedral structure. The unusually robust nature of this scaffold and its amenability to internal changes reveal its potential for nanoscale applications. </text>

      <text>Angiogenesis associated with visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue in severe human obesity. OBJECTIVE: The expansion of adipose tissue is linked to the development of its vasculature. However, the regulation of adipose tissue angiogenesis in humans has not been extensively studied. Our aim was to compare the angiogenesis associated with subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from the same obese patients in an in vivo model. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Adipose tissue samples from visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) sites, obtained from 36 obese patients (mean BMI 46.5 kg/m(2)) during bariatric surgery, were layered on chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). RESULTS: Both SAT and VAT expressed angiogenic factors without significant difference for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. Adipose tissue layered on CAM stimulated angiogenesis. Angiogenic stimulation was macroscopically detectable, with engulfment of the samples, in 39% and was evidenced by angiography in 59% of the samples. A connection between CAM and adipose tissue vessels was evidenced by immunohistochemistry, with recruitment of both avian and human endothelial cells. The angiogenic potency of adipose tissue was not related to its localization (with an angiogenic stimulation in 60% of SAT samples and 61% of VAT samples) or to adipocyte size or inflammatory infiltrate assessed in adipose samples before the graft on CAM. Stimulation of angiogenesis by adipose tissue was nearly abolished by bevacizumab, which specifically targets human VEGF. CONCLUSIONS: We have established a model to study the regulation of angiogenesis by human adipose tissue. This model highlighted the role of VEGF in angiogenesis in both SAT and VAT. </text>

      <text>M-CSF signals through the MAPK/ERK pathway via Sp1 to induce VEGF production and induces angiogenesis in vivo. BACKGROUND: M-CSF recruits mononuclear phagocytes which regulate processes such as angiogenesis and metastases in tumors. VEGF is a potent activator of angiogenesis as it promotes endothelial cell proliferation and new blood vessel formation. Previously, we reported that in vitro M-CSF induces the expression of biologically-active VEGF from human monocytes. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrate the molecular mechanism of M-CSF-induced VEGF production. Using a construct containing the VEGF promoter linked to a luciferase reporter, we found that a mutation reducing HIF binding to the VEGF promoter had no significant effect on luciferase production induced by M-CSF stimulation. Further analysis revealed that M-CSF induced VEGF through the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway via the transcription factor, Sp1. Thus, inhibition of either ERK or Sp1 suppressed M-CSF-induced VEGF at the mRNA and protein level. M-CSF also induced the nuclear localization of Sp1, which was blocked by ERK inhibition. Finally, mutating the Sp1 binding sites within the VEGF promoter or inhibiting ERK decreased VEGF promoter activity in M-CSF-treated human monocytes. To evaluate the biological significance of M-CSF induced VEGF production, we used an in vivo angiogenesis model to illustrate the ability of M-CSF to recruit mononuclear phagocytes, increase VEGF levels, and enhance angiogenesis. Importantly, the addition of a neutralizing VEGF antibody abolished M-CSF-induced blood vessel formation. CONCLUSION: These data delineate an ERK- and Sp1-dependent mechanism of M-CSF induced VEGF production and demonstrate for the first time the ability of M-CSF to induce angiogenesis via VEGF in vivo. </text>

      <text>PI3K/Akt-dependent transcriptional regulation and activation of BMP-2-Smad signaling by NF-kappaB in metastatic prostate cancer cells.  BACKGROUND: Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) exert osteoinductive effects in prostate cancer (PC) via uncharacterized mechanisms. In this study, we investigated whether the nuclear transcription factor NF-kappaB, implicated in PC metastasis, is involved in transcriptional regulation and activation of BMP-2 or BMP-4/Smad signaling in PC cells. METHODS: NF-kappaB inhibition was achieved by IkappaBalpha super-repressor adenoviral vector and activation was monitored by EMSA and reporter assays. BMP expression and activation was measured by PCR and reporter assays. Promoter binding assay was performed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation was measured by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: PCR and chimeric BMP-2 and BMP-4 luciferase assays demonstrate that NF-kappaB confers robust and selective activation of BMP-2 in p65 overexpressing or rhTNF-alpha-stimulated PC cells. Inhibition of NF-kappaB significantly reduced transcript levels and autocrine production of BMP-2 by rhTNF-alpha stimulated C4-2B cells and to a lesser extent by the parental LNCaP cells. Selective inhibition of PI3K/Akt suppressed the NF-kappaB-induced BMP-2 promoter activity. Furthermore, suppression of NF-kappaB activation decreased the transcript levels and BMP-2-induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8, critical downstream targets of BMP-2 signaling in PC cells. Notably, the activation of BMPRII by BMP-2 is required for modulation of Smad activation by NF-kappaB in PC cells. Based on ChIP analysis, the transcriptional regulation of BMP-2 gene by NF-kappaB may be partially attributed to binding to kappab site on the BMP-2 promoter. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that PI3K/Akt-NF-kappaB axis may promote PC bone metastasis in part by regulating transcription and activation of the BMP-2-Smad signaling cascade in osteotropic PC cells. </text>

      <text>Atypical mycobacteriosis of the larynx: an unusual clinical presentation secondary to steroids inhalation. Vocal cords stiffness can be associated with a variety of etiologic agents, but it is rarely seen with atypical mycobacteria, for example, Mycobacterium avium complex. We report a case of a 35-year-old white woman who is and was maintained on inhaled steroids. She presented with hoarseness and low-grade fever, but her medical history was otherwise unremarkable. Laryngoscopy revealed bilateral scarring of the vocal cords. Vocal cord biopsies were performed. Histologic examination revealed unremarkable laryngeal mucosa, except for abundant subepithelial non-necrotizing granulomata. The differential diagnosis included sarcoid, Klebsiella scleroma, and tuberculosis. Special stains reviewed abundant acid-fast bacilli, later confirmed by a DNA assay on induced deep sputum, consistent with M avium complex. Subsequently, steroids were withdrawn, and the patient was treated with a multiple-drug antituberculous regimen and had a full recovery. This unusual clinical presentation of the atypical mycobacteriosis may be encountered by otolaryngologists and pathologists, and it is critical to recognize it in patients immunocompromised because of steroids. </text>

      <text>A novel integrin alpha5beta1 antagonistic peptide, A5-1, screened by Protein Chip system as a potent angiogenesis inhibitor. Integrin alpha5beta1 immobilized on a ProteoChip was used to screen new antagonistic peptides from multiple hexapeptide sub-libraries of the positional scanning synthetic peptide combinatorial library (PS-SPCL). The integrin alpha5beta1-Fibronectin interaction was demonstrated on the chip. A novel peptide ligand, A5-1 (VILVLF), with high affinity to integrin alpha5beta1 was identified from the hexapeptide libraries with this chip-based screening method on the basis of a competitive inhibition assay. A5-1 inhibits the integrin-fibronectin interaction in a dose-dependent manner (IC(50); 1.56+/-0.28 microM. In addition, it inhibits human umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, tubular network formation, and bFGF-induced neovascularization in a chick chorioallantoic membrane. These results suggest that A5-1 will be a potent inhibitor of neovascularization. </text>

      <text>Are former female elite athletes more likely to experience urinary incontinence later in life than non-athletes? The aim of the present study was to investigate whether former female elite athletes are more likely to experience urinary incontinence (UI) later in life than non-athletes and to assess possible risk factors for UI in athletes. Three hundred and thirty-one former elite athletes (response rate 81%) and 640 controls replied to a postal questionnaire including validated questions on UI. While competing in sport, 10.9% and 2.7% of the former elite athletes reported stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and urge incontinence, respectively. Presently, 36.5% of the former elite athletes and 36.9% of the controls reported SUI. 9.1% and 9.4% reported urge incontinence. Among former elite athletes, those with two or three children were more likely than nulliparous women to have UI now. Also, among former athletes, UI was more common in women with vs those without UI while competing (odds ratio 8.57, 95% confidence interval: 3.55-20.71). Age, menopause and being regularly physically active now were not associated with UI in either group. Based on this study, the prevalence of UI does not seem to be higher in former athletes than in controls. However, the results indicate that UI early in life, as reported during elite sport, is a strong predictor of UI later in life. </text>

      <text>Evaluation of electrical stimulation for ischemic wound therapy: a feasibility study using the lapine wound model. Chronic wounds are a major secondary complication for many people with impaired mobility. Electrical stimulation (ES) has been recommended as a adjunctive therapy, however optimal treatment paradigms have not been established. Our group seeks to determine the basic mechanisms underlying ES wound therapy, an area where understanding is currently limited. A feasibility study was carried out to develop the Ahn/Mustoe lapine wound model for systematic investigation of the effects of electrical stimulation on ischemic wound therapy. A standardized surgical procedure incorporated a hybrid stimulation system comprising an implantable mini-stimulator and surface electrodes, with creation of repeatable ischemic wounds. Twenty mature male New Zealand white rabbits (3 kg weight) were employed to evaluate the effects of two empirically selected stimulation paradigms applied continuously for 7-21 days, using each animal as its own control. Outcomes measures included transcutaneous blood gas levels, histology, total RNA content and analysis of alpha2 (I) collagen (COL-I), type IV collagen (COL-IV), alpha1 (V) collagen (COL-V), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression using real-time quantitative PCR. All markers for stimulated wounds showed increased activity relative to non-stimulated control wounds between 7 and 14 days following injury, with peak activity at 14 days. By 21 days post-injury, all activity had returned to near baseline level. VEGF and COL-IV levels were found to be significantly higher for pattern A (110 mus pulse width) compared to pattern B (5 mus pulse width) at 14 days, implying that pattern A may be more effective at promoting angiogenesis. All wounds were fully re-epithelialized by 10 days post-injury. Both COL-I and COL-V showed statistically significant (P  less than  0.05) increased activity between day 7 and day 14 for pattern A, potentially indicating a continued effect on matrix remodeling. The early closure of all wounds implies that the rabbit ear model may not be valid for chronic wound studies. </text>

      <text>VEGF, angiopoietin-1 and -2 in bronchial asthma: new molecular targets in airway angiogenesis and microvascular remodeling. Airway angiogenesis and microvascular remodeling are known features of bronchial asthma, but the mechanisms of these structural alterations are just beginning to be elucidated. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), one of the most potent angiogenic factors, stimulates endothelial cell proliferation and induces the angiogenesis. Recently, considerable attentions have been devoted to the physiological roles of angiopoietin (Ang)-1 and -2 as regulatory factors of VEGF. Ang-1 has been shown to induce the migration and sprouting of endothelial cells, and coexpression of Ang-1 and VEGF enhanced angiogenesis. In the presence of high levels of VEGF, Ang-2 also promotes rapid increase in capillary diameter, remodeling of the basal lamina, proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, and stimulates sprouting of new blood vessels. Thus, VEGF, Ang-1 and -2 may play complementary and coordinated roles in airway angiogenesis and microvascular remodeling, and these structural changes are potentially reversible by therapeutic intervention. The scope of the present review is to discuss from a clinical point of view the potential interactions between VEGF and angiopoietins in the asthmatic airways, and focus on the therapeutic implications targeting for these angiogenic factors. Recently, there is an increasing number of patents which have been focused on the inhibitors of VEGF action. These inhibitors are directed towards the receptors of VEGF or intracellular substrates for the receptors. We will also discuss several patents regarding inhibitors of VEGF action in the present review. </text>

      <text>Effect of transplanted mesenchymal stem cells from rats of different ages on the improvement of heart function after acute myocardial infarction. BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation is of therapeutic potential after ischemic injury in both experimental and clinical studies. Clinically, elderly patients are more vulnerable to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). But little is known about the characteristics of young donor-derived MSCs transplanted to old patients with AMI. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of transplanted MSCs from rats of different ages on the improvement of heart function after AMI. METHODS: MSCs from Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were isolated and cultured in vitro. The apoptosis characteristics of MSCs were observed under conditions of ischemia and anoxia. SD rats underwent MI received intramyocardial injection of MSCs from young donor rats (n = 8), old donor rats (n = 8), respectively. AMI control group received equal volume physiological saline. Immunofluorescence was used to observe the differentiation of the grafted cells into cardiomyocytes. Four weeks after cell transplantation, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VIII-factor immunohistochemistry for vessel density, TUNEL, caspase-3 for cardiomyocyte apoptosis, echocardiography and hemodynamic detection for heart function were performed. RESULTS: The apoptosis rate of the old donor-derived MSCs group was significantly higher than that of the young donor-derived MSCs group under conditions of ischemia and anoxia (P  less than  0.05). Engrafted MSCs survived, proliferated and differentiated into myocardium-like cells. VEGF gene expression and capillary density in the old donor-derived group were lower than those in the young donor-derived group but higher than those in the control group (P  less than  0.05). The transplantation of old donor-derived MSCs attenuated apoptosis of cardiomyocytes in the peri-infarct region compared with the control group and the effect was elevated in young donor-derived MSCs (P  less than  0.05). The heart functions (left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricle fractional shortening (LVFS)) were improved more significantly in the old donor-derived MSCs group than in the control group and the heart function in the young donor-derived MSCs group further improved (P  less than  0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Young donor-derived MSCs can improve heart function significantly through angiogenesis and decreasing cardiomyocyte apoptosis when transplanted to the infarcted area. </text>

      <text>Clinical significance of chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II expression in human colorectal cancer. Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) plays an essential role in angiogenesis and development. A previous study showed that the expression of COUP-TFII enhanced invasiveness of human lung carcinoma cells. However, no published data are available concerning the biological and clinical significance of COUP-TFII expression in colorectal cancer. Thus, our objective was to explore the expression of COUP-TFII in colorectal cancer as well as its association with clinicopathological features, and to evaluate the role of COUP-TFII as a prognostic indicator in colorectal cancer. We investigated the presence of COUP-TFII in human colorectal cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues from 95 primary colorectal cancer patients by immunohistochemistry. The correlation between the expression of COUP-TFII and clinicopathologic features was investigated. The 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with tumors expressing different levels of COUP-TFII were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method. No significant correlation was found between COUP-TFII expression and age at surgery, gender, histopathologic differentiation, vessel invasion, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), or nodal involvement. However, survival analysis showed that the COUP-TFII-positive group had a significantly better OS compared to COUP-TFII-negative group (80.4% vs. 57.7%, P=0.0491). Based on our results, COUP-TFII may represent a biomarker for good prognosis in colorectal cancer. </text>

      <text>Homeostatic functions of the p53 tumor suppressor: regulation of energy metabolism and antioxidant defense. The p53 tumor suppressor plays pivotal role in the organism by supervising strict compliance of individual cells to needs of the whole organisms. It has been widely accepted that p53 acts in response to stresses and abnormalities in cell physiology by mobilizing the repair processes or by removing the diseased cells through initiating the cell death programs. Recent studies, however, indicate that even under normal physiological conditions certain activities of p53 participate in homeostatic regulation of metabolic processes and that these activities are important for prevention of cancer. These novel functions of p53 help to align metabolic processes with the proliferation and energy status, to maintain optimal mode of glucose metabolism and to boost the energy efficient mitochondrial respiration in response to ATP deficiency. Additional activities of p53 in non-stressed cells tune up the antioxidant defense mechanisms reducing the probability of mutations caused by DNA oxidation under conditions of daily stresses. The deficiency in the p53-mediated regulation of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration greatly accounts for the deficient respiration of the predominance of aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells (the Warburg effect), while the deficiency in the p53-modulated antioxidant defense mechanisms contributes to mutagenesis and additionally boosts the carcinogenesis process. </text>

      <text>Involvement of PTEN promoter methylation in cerebral cavernous malformations. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are prevalent cerebral vascular lesions involving aberrant angiogenesis. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Phosphatase and tension homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), a tumor suppressor, is frequently deficient in various pathologies due to mutation or epigenetic alterations. PTEN promoter hypermethylation is a major epigenetic silencing mechanism leading to activation of angiogenesis in tumors. The present study aimed to investigate whether PTEN promoter methylation was involved in CCMs. METHODS: PTEN promoter methylation was detected in surgical specimens of CCMs (n=69) by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. The methylation status was correlated to the clinical manifestations and to PTEN expression, which was analyzed by both Western blot and immunohistochemistry. To investigate the endothelial proliferation and the potential signaling pathways affected by PTEN methylation, proliferating cell nuclear antigen as well as phosphor-Akt and phosphor-Erk1,2 were detected by immunofluorescence and Western blot, respectively, in CCM specimens. RESULTS: Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction revealed PTEN promoter methylation in 15.9% CCMs. Strikingly, 5 of 6 familial CCMs showed PTEN promoter methylation (83.3%), which was significantly higher than in sporadic cases (9.4%; P&lt;0.001). In addition, PTEN promoter methylation appeared more frequently in multiple CCMs, including familial cases (46.7%), than that in single-lesioned CCMs (11.8%; P&lt;0.05). Immunostaining and Western blot revealed a more significant PTEN downregulation in PTEN-methylated CCMs in comparison to PTEN-unmethylated CCMs. Reduced PTEN expression was inversely correlated to the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and to the activation of Erk1,2, but not of Akt. CONCLUSIONS: We reported here for the first time the involvement of PTEN promoter methylation in CCMs, particularly in familial CCMs, suggesting this epigenetic alteration as a potential pathomechanism of CCMs. The identification of Erk1,2 as triggered signaling in the lesions may be valuable for the development of effective therapy for this disease. </text>

      <text>Aflibercept (AVE0005): an alternative strategy for inhibiting tumour angiogenesis by vascular endothelial growth factors. BACKGROUND: Aberrant angiogenesis is a landmark feature in cancer, which is important for proliferation, growth and metastasis, and is mediated by various pro-angiogenic factors. The VEGF pathway is one of the most important and best-studied angiogenic pathways. Inhibition of this pathway may provide clinical benefits to cancer patients. OBJECTIVES: Strategies to inhibit the VEGF pathway, including antibodies to VEGF, antibodies to the extracellular domain of VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2, decoy receptors for VEGF and tyrosine kinase inhibitors of VEGFRs, are summarized. METHODS: This review outlines and compares the latest development of these strategies, with emphasis on aflibercept, a novel decoy fusion protein of domain 2 of VEGFR-1 and domain 3 of VEGFR-2 with the Fc fragment of IgG1. RESULTS: Aflibercept was shown to have early clinical activity. Multiple studies are ongoing to determine the clinical benefits of aflibercept in cancer patients. </text>

      <text>Handling within run retention time shifts in two-dimensional chromatography data using shift correction and modeling. The use of PARAFAC for modeling GC x GC-TOFMS peaks is well documented. This success is due to the trilinear structure of these data under ideal, or sufficiently close to ideal, chromatographic conditions. However, using temperature programming to cope with the general elution problem, deviations from trilinearity within a run are more likely to be seen for the following three cases: (1) compounds (i.e., analytes) severely broadened on the first column hence defined by many modulation periods, (2) analytes with a very high retention factor on the second column and likely wrapped around in that dimension, or (3) with fast temperature program rates. This deviation from trilinearity is seen as retention time-shifted peak profiles in subsequent modulation periods (first column fractions). In this report, a relaxed yet powerful version of PARAFAC, known as PARAFAC2 has been applied to handle this shift within the model step by allowing generation of individual peak profiles in subsequent first column fractions. An alternative approach was also studied, utilizing a standard retention time shift correction to restore the data trilinearity structure followed by PARAFAC. These two approaches are compared when identifying and quantifying a known analyte over a large concentration series where a certain shift is simulated in the successive first column fractions. Finally, the methods are applied to real chromatographic data showing severely shifted peak profiles. The pros and cons of the presented approaches are discussed in relation to the model parameters, the signal-to-noise ratio and the degree of shift. </text>

      <text>The effect of perfluorocarbon-based artificial oxygen carriers on tissue-engineered trachea. The biological effect of the perfluorocarbon-based artificial oxygen carrier (Oxygent) was investigated in tissue-engineered trachea (TET) construction. Media supplemented with and without 10% Oxygent were compared in all assessments. Partial tissue oxygen tension (PtO(2)) was measured with polarographic microprobes; epithelial metabolism was monitored by microdialysis inside the TET epithelium perfused with the medium underneath. Chondrocyte-DegraPol constructs were cultured for 1 month with the medium before glycosaminoglycan assessment and histology. Tissue reaction of TET epithelial scaffolds immersed with the medium was evaluated on the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane. Oxygent perfusion medium increased the TET epithelial PtO(2) (51.2 +/- 0.3 mm Hg vs. 33.4 +/- 0.3 mm Hg at 200 microm thickness; 12.5 +/- 0.1 mm Hg vs. 3.1 +/- 0.1 mm Hg at 400 microm thickness, p  less than  0.01) and decreased the lactate concentration (0.63 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.80 +/- 0.06 mmol/L, p  less than  0.05), lactate/pyruvate (1.87 +/- 0.26 vs. 3.36 +/- 10.13, p  less than  0.05), and lactate/glucose ratios (0.10 +/- 0.00 vs. 0.29 +/- 0.14, p  less than  0.05). Chondrocyte-DegraPol in Oxygent group presented lower glycosaminoglycan value (0.03 +/- 0.00 vs. 0.13 +/- 0.00, p  less than  0.05); histology slides showed poor acid mucopolysaccharides formation. Orthogonal polarization spectral imaging showed no difference in functional capillary density between the scaffolds cultured on chorioallantoic membranes. The foreign body reaction was similar in both groups. We conclude that Oxygent increases TET epithelial PtO(2), improves epithelial metabolism, does not impair angiogenesis, and tends to slow cartilage tissue formation. </text>

      <text>The semaphorin 7A receptor Plexin C1 is lost during melanoma metastasis. The transformation of normal melanocytes, or melanocyte stem cells, to melanoma, is a complex process involving multiple mechanisms. Loss of tumor suppressor proteins, which function as brakes on cell growth, migration, or cell survival, was recognized early on as an important mechanism for initiation and progression of melanoma. Semaphorins and their cognate receptors, Plexins and neuropilins, are involved in neuronal pathfinding, immune function, and tumor progression through effects on blood vessel growth and cell migration. Semaphorin 7A (Sema7A) is a membrane-linked semaphorin that is expressed by human keratinocytes, and we have shown that Sema7A binds to human melanocytes through beta1-integrins and the Plexin C1 receptor. Functional studies showed that Sema7A stimulates cytoskeletal reorganization in human melanocytes, resulting in adhesion and dendrite formation. Downstream targets of Plexin C1 signaling in human melanocytes include cofilin and LIM kinase II, both of which are critical mediators of cell adhesion and migration. In this report, we analyzed the expression of Plexin C1 using immunohistochemistry on sections of primary and matched metastatic lesions from 19 subjects and in a large melanoma tumor microarray. Our data show a significant loss of Plexin C1 in metastatic melanoma compared with primary melanoma, suggesting the possibility that the Plexin C1 receptor is a tumor suppressor protein for melanoma. </text>

      <text>Coagulation function in patients with pancreatic carcinoma.  BACKGROUND: The coagulation function in patients with pancreatic carcinoma is abnormal and the reason is not very clear. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the coagulation function in patients with pancreatic carcinoma. METHODS: From June 2004 to December 2007, 132 patients received diagnosis and treatment in our hospital. The coagulative parameters including the prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen levels were collected and studied retrospectively. RESULTS: The average fibrinogen levels in patients with pancreatic carcinoma, (476.21 +/- 142.05) mg/dl, were significantly higher than in patients with cholangiolithiasis, (403.28 +/- 126.41) mg/dl (P &lt; 0.05). In patients with pancreatic carcinoma, the levels of fibrinogen in the group with jaundice were significantly higher than in patients without jaundice (P &lt; 0.05). In patients who received Pancreaticoduodenectomy, Whipple's operation, the level of fibrinogen in the group with local invasiveness was significantly higher than in the group without invasiveness. The group with lymphatic metastasis had higher levels than the group without lymphatic metastasis (P &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference of intraoperative blood loss between patients with vitamin K, (748.27 +/- 448.51) ml, and those without vitamin K, (767.31 +/- 547.89) ml (P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The level of fibrinogen in patients with pancreatic carcinoma was elevated. The elevated fibrinogen level may be associated with invasiveness and lymphatic metastasis. Using vitamin K in perioperation management did not reduce intraoperative blood loss. </text>

      <text>Molecular analysis of genetic instability caused by chronic inflammation.  Genetic instability is a hallmark of human cancers. It is the driving force for tumor development as it facilitates the accumulation of mutations in genes that regulate cell death and proliferation and therefore promotes malignant transformation. Chronic inflammation is a common underlying condition for human tumor development, accounting for approximately 20% of human cancers. TNFalpha is an important inflammation cytokine and is crucial to the development of inflammation-associated cancers. We have shown that TNFalpha can cause DNA damages through reactive oxygen species (ROS). TNFalpha treatment in cultured cells resulted in increased gene mutations, gene amplification, micronuclei formation and chromosomal instability. Antioxidants significantly reduced TNFalpha-induced genetic damage. In addition, TNFalpha treatment alone led to increased malignant transformation of mouse embryo fibroblasts, which could be partially suppressed by antioxidants. Therefore, genetic instability plays an important role in inflammation-associated cancers. </text>

      <text>PTTG overexpression promotes lymph node metastasis in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.  Human pituitary tumor transforming gene (PTTG) overexpression correlates with metastasis in multiple tumors, and yet its molecular mechanisms of action remain elusive. We detected PTTG overexpression in 66% (111 of 169) of primary esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tumor tissues by in situ hybridization. PTTG overexpression correlated with lymph node metastasis (P &lt; 0.05). Ectopic PTTG overexpression in a representative ESCC cell line, EC9706, increased in vitro cell migration and invasion and promoted in vivo lymph node metastasis. Suppressing PTTG expression by siRNA decreased cell motility in both PTTG-HA/EC9706 and KYSE150 cells. By using mass spectrometric analysis, we identified that PTTG up-regulated S100A4 and galectin-1 secretion and down-regulated tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 secretion to the culture media. PTTG induced S100A4 and galectin-1 mRNA and protein expression as assessed by Western blot and reverse transcription-PCR. Attenuating galectin-1 expression by siRNA constrained PTTG-HA/EC9706 cell motility (P &lt; 0.05). PTTG activated E-box transcription and induced c-Myc protein expression in EC9706 cells, which in turn may act on an E-box motif within the galectin-1 promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further confirmed specific c-Myc binding to galectin-1 promoter. PTTG-induced galectin-1 transactivation and expression were mediated by c-Myc, and both inductions were suppressed by c-Myc RNAi cotranfection. These findings elucidate the molecular mechanisms of PTTG overexpression in promoting tumor metastasis, whereby up-regulated PTTG modulates expression and secretion of metastasis-related factors to facilitate cell motility. </text>

      <text>Characterization of the metabolic changes underlying growth factor angiogenic activation: identification of new potential therapeutic targets. Angiogenesis is a fundamental process to normal and abnormal tissue growth and repair, which consists of recruiting endothelial cells toward an angiogenic stimulus. The cells subsequently proliferate and differentiate to form endothelial tubes and capillary-like structures. Little is known about the metabolic adaptation of endothelial cells through such a transformation. We studied the metabolic changes of endothelial cell activation by growth factors using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), [1,2-(13)C(2)]-glucose and mass isotopomer distribution analysis. The metabolism of [1,2-(13)C(2)]-glucose by HUVEC allows us to trace many of the main glucose metabolic pathways, including glycogen synthesis, the pentose cycle and the glycolytic pathways. So we established that these pathways were crucial to endothelial cell proliferation under vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) stimulation. A specific VEGF receptor-2 inhibitor demonstrated the importance of glycogen metabolism and pentose cycle pathway. Furthermore, we showed that glycogen was depleted in a low glucose medium, but conserved under hypoxic conditions. Finally, we demonstrated that direct inhibition of key enzymes to glycogen metabolism and pentose phosphate pathways reduced HUVEC viability and migration. In this regard, inhibitors of these pathways have been shown to be effective antitumoral agents. To sum up, our data suggest that the inhibition of metabolic pathways offers a novel and powerful therapeutic approach, which simultaneously inhibits tumor cell proliferation and tumor-induced angiogenesis. </text>

      <text>Rab GTPase regulation of VEGFR2 trafficking and signaling in endothelial cells. OBJECTIVE: Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates vascular physiology. However, mechanism(s) by which VEGFR2 signaling and trafficking is coordinated are not clear. Here, we have tested endocytic Rab GTPases for regulation of VEGFR2 trafficking and signaling linked to endothelial cell migration. METHODS AND RESULTS: Quiescent VEGFR2 displays endosomal localization and colocalization with the Rab5a GTPase, an early endosome fusion regulator. Expression of GTP or GDP-bound Rab5a mutants block activated VEGFR2 trafficking and degradation. Manipulation of Rab7a GTPase activity associated with late endosomes using overexpression of wild-type or mutant proteins blocks activated VEGFR2 trafficking and degradation. Depletion of Rab7a decreased VEGFR2 Y1175 phosphorylation but increased p42/44 (pERK1/2) MAPK phosphorylation. Endothelial cell migration was increased by Rab5a depletion but decreased by Rab7a depletion. CONCLUSIONS: Rab5a and Rab7a regulate VEGFR2 trafficking toward early and late endosomes. Our data suggest that VEGFR2-mediated regulation of endothelial function is dependent on different but specific Rab-mediated GTP hydrolysis activity required for endosomal trafficking. </text>

      <text>FOXO3a elicits a pro-apoptotic transcription program and cellular response to human lung carcinogen nicotine-derived nitrosaminoketone (NNK).  Long-term carcinogen exposure exerts continuous pressure on key mechanisms that repair or eliminate carcinogen-damaged cells giving rise to selective failures that contribute to lung cancer. FOXO3a is a transcription factor that elicits a protective response to diverse cellular stresses. Although implicated as a tumor suppressor, its role in sporadic cancer is uncertain. We recently observed that FOXO3a gene inactivation occurs frequently in carcinogen-induced lung adenocarcinoma (LAC). This suggests that FOXO3a may play a role in LAC suppression by eliciting a protective response to carcinogenic stress. Here we investigated this possibility by examining the role of FOXO3a in the cellular response to nicotine-derived nitrosaminoketone (NNK), a lung carcinogen implicated as a cause of human LAC. We show that restoration of FOXO3a in FOXO3a-deficient LAC cells increases sensitivity to apoptosis caused by a DNA-damaging intermediate of NNK. Prior to this cellular outcome, FOXO3a is functionally activated and mediates a large-scale transcription program in response to this damage involving a significant modulation of 440 genes. Genes most significantly represented in this program are those with roles in cell growth and proliferation&gt;protein synthesis&gt;gene expression&gt;cell death&gt;cell cycle. The results of this study show that FOXO3a directs an anti-carcinogenic transcription program that culminates in the elimination of carcinogen-damaged cells. This suggests that FOXO3a is a potential suppressor of carcinogenic damage in LAC. </text>

      <text>Bmi-1 over-expression in neural stem/progenitor cells increases proliferation and neurogenesis in culture but has little effect on these functions in vivo.  The polycomb gene Bmi-1 is required for the self-renewal of stem cells from diverse tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). Bmi-1 expression is elevated in most human gliomas, irrespective of grade, raising the question of whether Bmi-1 over-expression is sufficient to promote self-renewal or tumorigenesis by CNS stem/progenitor cells. To test this we generated Nestin-Bmi-1-GFP transgenic mice. Analysis of two independent lines with expression in the fetal and adult CNS demonstrated that transgenic neural stem cells formed larger colonies, more self-renewing divisions, and more neurons in culture. However, in vivo, Bmi-1 over-expression had little effect on CNS stem cell frequency, subventricular zone proliferation, olfactory bulb neurogenesis, or neurogenesis/gliogenesis during development. Bmi-1 transgenic mice were born with enlarged lateral ventricles and a minority developed idiopathic hydrocephalus as adults, but none of the transgenic mice formed detectable CNS tumors, even when aged. The more pronounced effects of Bmi-1 over-expression in culture were largely attributable to the attenuated induction of p16(Ink4a) and p19(Arf) in culture, proteins that are generally not expressed by neural stem/progenitor cells in young mice in vivo. Bmi-1 over-expression therefore has more pronounced effects in culture and does not appear to be sufficient to induce tumorigenesis in vivo. </text>

      <text>Erbb2 suppresses DNA damage-induced checkpoint activation and UV-induced mouse skin tumorigenesis.  The Erbb2 receptor is activated by UV irradiation, the primary cause of non-melanoma skin cancer. We hypothesized that Erbb2 activation contributes to UV-induced skin tumorigenesis by suppressing cell cycle arrest. Consistent with this hypothesis, inhibition of Erbb2 in v-ras(Ha) transgenic mice before UV exposure resulted in both 56% fewer skin tumors and tumors that were 70% smaller. Inhibition of the UV-induced activation of Erbb2 also resulted in milder epidermal hyperplasia, S-phase accumulation, and decreased levels of the cell cycle regulator Cdc25a, suggesting altered cell cycle regulation on inhibition of Erbb2. Further investigation using inhibition or genetic deletion of Erbb2 in vitro revealed reduced Cdc25a levels and increased S-phase arrest in UV-irradiated cells lacking Erbb2 activity. Ectopic expression of Cdc25a prevented UV-induced S-phase arrest in keratinocytes lacking Erbb2 activity, demonstrating that maintenance of Cdc25a by Erbb2 suppresses cell cycle arrest. Examination of checkpoint pathway activation upstream of Cdc25a revealed Erbb2 activation did not alter Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related/Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated activity but increased inhibitory phosphorylation of Chk1-Ser(280). Since Akt phosphorylates Chk1-Ser(280), the effect of Erbb2 on phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling during UV-induced cell cycle arrest was determined. Erbb2 ablation reduced the UV-induced activation of PI3K while inhibition of PI3K/Akt increased UV-induced S-phase arrest. Thus, UV-induced Erbb2 activation increases skin tumorigenesis through inhibitory phosphorylation of Chk1, Cdc25a maintenance, and suppression of S-phase arrest via a PI3K/Akt-dependent mechanism. </text>

      <text>The EGFR-GEP100-Arf6-AMAP1 signaling pathway specific to breast cancer invasion and metastasis.  Tumors are tissue-specific diseases, and their mechanisms of invasion and metastasis are highly diverse. In breast cancer, biomarkers that specifically correlate with the invasive phenotypes have not been clearly identified. A small GTPase Arf6 primarily regulates recycling of plasma membrane components. We have shown that Arf6 and its effector AMAP1 (DDEF1, DEF1, ASAP1 and centaurin beta4) are abnormally overexpressed in some breast cancers and used for their invasion and metastasis. Overexpression of these proteins is independent of the transcriptional upregulation of their genes, and occurs only in highly malignant breast cancer cells. We recently identified GEP100 (BRAG2) to be responsible for the Arf6 activation to induce invasion and metastasis, by directly binding to ligand-activated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). A series of our studies revealed that for activation of the invasion pathway of EGFR, it is prerequisite that Arf6 and AMAP1 both are highly overexpressed, and that EGFR is activated by ligands. Pathological analyses indicate that a significant large population of human ductal cancers may utilize the EGFR-GEP100-Arf6-AMAP1 pathway for their malignancy. Microenvironments have been highly implicated in the malignancy of mammary tumors. Our results reveal an aspect of the precise molecular mechanisms of some breast cancers, in which full invasiveness is not acquired just by intracellular alterations of cancer cells, but extracellular factors from microenvironments may also be necessary. Possible translation of our knowledge to cancer therapeutics will also be discussed. </text>

      <text>Met amplification and tumor progression in Cdkn2a-deficient melanocytes.  While many genetic alterations have been identified in melanoma, the relevant molecular events that contribute to disease progression are poorly understood. Most primary human melanomas exhibit loss of expression of the CDKN2A locus in addition to activation of the canonical mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. In this study, we used a Cdkn2a-deficient mouse melanocyte cell line to screen for secondary genetic events in melanoma tumor progression. Upon investigation, intrachromosomal gene amplification of Met, a receptor tyrosine kinase implicated in melanoma progression, was identified in Cdkn2a-deficient tumors. RNA interference targeting Met in these tumor cells resulted in a significant delay in tumor growth in vivo compared with the control cells. MET expression is rarely detected in primary human melanoma but is frequently observed in metastatic disease. This study validates a role for Met activation in melanoma tumor progression in the context of Cdkn2a deficiency. </text>

      <text>Activated platelets enhance ovarian cancer cell invasion in a cellular model of metastasis.  Increased platelet counts and systemic coagulation activation are associated with ovarian cancer progression. Platelet activation occurs in the tumor microenvironment and may influence local invasion and metastasis. We used a cellular model of tumor invasion to investigate the effect of activated platelets on the human ovarian cancer cell line, SKOV3. SKOV3 cells were exposed to washed, thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP)-activated or TRAP-naive platelets under various experimental conditions, and tumor cell invasion was assayed in Matrigel chambers. The effect of platelets on the content of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and VEGF in SKOV3 cell conditioned medium was measured using an ELISA assay. TRAP-activated platelets stimulated a dose-dependent increase in SKOV3 cell invasion. Exposure to activated platelet membranes and to soluble proteins contained in activated platelet releasate both contributed to the observed increase in invasion. The inhibition of platelet activation with prostaglandin E1 (PGE(1)) attenuated the invasive capacity of SKOV3 cells. Exposure to platelets resulted in significantly increased uPA and VEGF content of SKOV3 cell conditioned medium. Activated platelets enhance SKOV3 human ovarian cancer cell invasion through Matrigel and increase the amount of uPA and VEGF secreted into SKOV3 cell conditioned medium. If generalizable to additional cell lines and human disease, this observation may partially explain the adverse prognosis associated with thrombocytosis in ovarian cancer. Platelets, therefore, may represent a potential target for therapeutic intervention in human ovarian cancer. </text>

      <text>AngiomiRs--key regulators of angiogenesis. The formation of new blood vessels through the process of angiogenesis is critical in vascular development and homeostasis. Aberrant angiogenesis leads to a variety of diseases, such as ischemia and cancer. Recent studies have revealed important roles for miRNAs in regulating endothelial cell (EC) function, especially angiogenesis. Mice with EC-specific deletion of Dicer, a key enzyme for generating miRNAs, display defective postnatal angiogenesis. Specific miRNAs (angiomiRs) have recently been shown to regulate angiogenesis in vivo. miRNA-126, an EC-restricted miRNA, regulates vascular integrity and developmental angiogenesis. miR-378, miR-296, and the miR-17-92 cluster contribute to tumor angiogenesis. Manipulating angiomiRs in the settings of pathological vascularization represents a new therapeutic approach. </text>

      <text>[Incidence of fungal infection in surgical diseases of the pancreas]. Recently the number of mycotic infections has increased significantly. Authors have observed 13 mycotic infections on operated patients suffering pancreatic diseases between 1984 and 1990. 9 of 13 patients had pancreatic abscesses as well. The risk factors of fungal infections are analysed. It is important to take differentiation between fungal colonisation and septicaemia caused by yeasts. Repeated microbiological examinations can promote recognising of the fungal invasion. The base of the therapy is to avoid risk factors of infections and to use antifungal medication in time. </text>

      <text>Promoting angiogenesis via manipulation of VEGF responsiveness with notch signaling. Promoting angiogenesis via delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other angiogenic factors is both a potential therapy for cardiovascular diseases and a critical aspect for tissue regeneration. The recent demonstration that VEGF signaling is modulated by the Notch signaling pathway, however, suggests that inhibiting Notch signaling may enhance regional neovascularization, by altering the responsiveness of local endothelial cells to angiogenic stimuli. We tested this possibility with in vitro assays using human endothelial cells, as well as in a rodent hindlimb ischemia model. Treatment of cultured human endothelial cells with DAPT, a gamma secretase inhibitor, increased cell migration and sprout formation in response to VEGF stimulation with a biphasic dependence on DAPT concentration. Further, delivery of an appropriate combination of DAPT and VEGF from an injectable alginate hydrogel system into ischemic hindlimbs led to a faster recovery of blood flow than VEGF or DAPT alone; perfusion levels reached 80% of the normal level by week 4 with combined DAPT and VEGF delivery. Direct intramuscular or intraperitoneal injection of DAPT did not result in the same level of improvement, suggesting that appropriate presentation of DAPT (gel delivery) is important for its activity. DAPT delivery from the hydrogels also did not lead to any adverse side effects, in contrast to systemic introduction of DAPT. Altogether, these results suggest a new approach to promote angiogenesis by controlling Notch signaling, and may provide new options to treat patients with diseases that diminish angiogenic responsiveness. </text>

      <text>[Activation of sterol regulatory element binding protein and its involvement in endothelial cell migration] OBJECTIVE: To study the activation of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) and its critical role in endothelial cell migration. METHODS: Bovine aortic endothelial cells (ECs) were cultured. The expression of SREBP and Cdc42 were determined by Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR. Moreover, outward growth migration model and transwell chamber assay were used to detect ECs migration. RESULTS: (1) SREBP was activated during ECs migration. Western blot analysis demonstrated increased active form SREBP in migrating as compared to non-migrating ECs population. SREBP activation decreased as ECs migration slowed;(2) Coincidental with SREBP activation, mRNA expression of its target genes such as low density lipoprotein receptor, HMG-CoA reductase, and fatty acid synthase also increased in migrating ECs population as detected by real-time PCR; (3) Migration induced SREBP activation in ECs was inhibited by SREBP-acting protein RNAi and pharmacologically by 25-hydroxycholesterol; (4) Inhibition of SREBP led to decreased ECs migration in various models; (5) Cells genetically deficient in SREBP-acting protein, S1P, or S2P, phenotypically exhibited impaired migration; (6) SREBP inhibition in ECs suppressed the activity of small GTPase Cdc42, a key molecule for ECs motility. CONCLUSIONS: SREBP is activated during and plays a critical role in ECs migration. Targeting SREBP could become a novel approach in fighting diseases involving abnormal ECs migration. </text>

      <text>Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2-positive fibroblasts provide a suitable microenvironment for tumor development and progression in esophageal carcinoma. PURPOSE: Tumor fibroblasts (TF) have been suggested to play an essential role in the complex process of tumor-stroma interactions and tumorigenesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the specific role of TF in the esophageal cancer microenvironment. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: An Affymetrix expression microarray was used to compare gene expression profiles between six pairs of TFs and normal fibroblasts from esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Differentially expressed genes were identified, and a subset was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: About 43% (126 of 292) of known deregulated genes in TFs were associated with cell proliferation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and immune response. Up-regulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), which showed the most significant change, was detected in all six tested TFs compared with their paired normal fibroblasts. A further study found that FGFR2-positive fibroblasts were only observed inside the tumor tissues and not in tumor-surrounding stromal tissues, suggesting that FGFR2 could be used as a TF-specific marker in ESCC. Moreover, the conditioned medium from TFs was found to be able to promote ESCC tumor cell growth, migration, and invasion in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides new candidate genes for the esophageal cancer microenvironment. Based on our results, we hypothesize that FGFR2(+)-TFs might provide cancer cells with a suitable microenvironment via secretion of proteins that could promote cancer development and progression through stimulation of cancer cell proliferation, induction of angiogenesis, inhibition of cell adhesion, enhancement of cell mobility, and promotion of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. </text>

      <text>[Role of the tumor suppressor ARF in oncogenesis] The paper reviews the data available in the literature on a role of the tumor suppressor ARF in oncogenesis and considers the structure of a gene encoding ARF protein. The p53-dependent and p-53-independent functions of this protein are under many studies. There is evidence for the implication of ARF in angiogenesis. There is more and more information on the role of ARF in the regulation of a cell cycle, apoptosis, and autophagy. The importance of this tumor suppressor in the mechanisms of carcinogenesis is beyond question as the inactivation of ARF suppressor activity leads to the rapid growth of neoplasia. However, the exact mechanisms of ARF action yet remain unclear and require further studies by different specialists at both the molecular genetic and other levels of investigation. </text>

      <text>Mechanical regulation of the proangiogenic factor CCN1/CYR61 gene requires the combined activities of MRTF-A and CREB-binding protein histone acetyltransferase. Smooth muscle-rich tissues respond to mechanical overload by an adaptive hypertrophic growth combined with activation of angiogenesis, which potentiates their mechanical overload-bearing capabilities. Neovascularization is associated with mechanical strain-dependent induction of angiogenic factors such as CCN1, an immediate-early gene-encoded matricellular molecule critical for vascular development and repair. Here we have demonstrated that mechanical strain-dependent induction of the CCN1 gene involves signaling cascades through RhoA-mediated actin remodeling and the p38 stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK). Actin signaling controls serum response factor (SRF) activity via SRF interaction with the myocardin-related transcriptional activator (MRTF)-A and tethering to a single CArG box sequence within the CCN1 promoter. Such activity was abolished in mechanically stimulated mouse MRTF-A(-/-) cells or upon inhibition of CREB-binding protein (CBP) histone acetyltransferase (HAT) either pharmacologically or by siRNAs. Mechanical strain induced CBP-mediated acetylation of histones 3 and 4 at the SRF-binding site and within the CCN1 gene coding region. Inhibition of p38 SAPK reduced CBP HAT activity and its recruitment to the SRF.MRTF-A complex, whereas enforced induction of p38 by upstream activators (e.g. MKK3 and MKK6) enhanced both CBP HAT and CCN1 promoter activities. Similarly, mechanical overload-induced CCN1 gene expression in vivo was associated with nuclear localization of MRTF-A and enrichment of the CCN1 promoter with both MRTF-A and acetylated histone H3. Taken together, these data suggest that signal-controlled activation of SRF, MRTF-A, and CBP provides a novel connection between mechanical stimuli and angiogenic gene expression. </text>

      <text>Angiogenesis in platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1-null mice. Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1 has been previously implicated in endothelial cell migration; additionally, anti-PECAM-1 antibodies have been shown to inhibit in vivo angiogenesis. Studies were therefore performed with PECAM-1-null mice to further define the involvement of PECAM-1 in blood vessel formation. Vascularization of subcutaneous Matrigel implants as well as tumor angiogenesis were both inhibited in PECAM-1-null mice. Reciprocal bone marrow transplants that involved both wild-type and PECAM-1-deficient mice revealed that the impaired angiogenic response resulted from a loss of endothelial, but not leukocyte, PECAM-1. In vitro wound migration and single-cell motility by PECAM-1-null endothelial cells were also compromised. In addition, filopodia formation, a feature of motile cells, was inhibited in PECAM-1-null endothelial cells as well as in human endothelial cells treated with either anti-PECAM-1 antibody or PECAM-1 siRNA. Furthermore, the expression of PECAM-1 promoted filopodia formation and increased the protein expression levels of Cdc42, a Rho GTPase that is known to promote the formation of filopodia. In the developing retinal vasculature, numerous, long filamentous filopodia, emanating from endothelial cells at the tips of angiogenic sprouts, were observed in wild-type animals, but to a lesser extent in the PECAM-1-null mice. Together, these data further establish the involvement of endothelial PECAM-1 in angiogenesis and suggest that, in vivo, PECAM-1 may stimulate endothelial cell motility by promoting the formation of filopodia. </text>

      <text>Desipramine inhibits the growth of a mouse skin squamous cell carcinoma cell line and affects glucocorticoid receptor-mediated transcription.  The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of tricyclic antidepressant desipramine (DMI) on the growth inhibition and translocation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in cancerous and noncancerous cell lines and the effect of DMI on GR-mediated transcription. Nontumorigenic, immortalized keratinocytes cell line (3PC), papilloma (MT1/2), and squamous cell carcinoma (Ca3/7) cell lines were initially used to study the cell growth inhibition by DMI. Although, the growth of all three cell lines was suppressed by DMI, it was more effective in Ca3/7 cells. Therefore, we next examined the effect of DMI on Ca3/7 cells, resistant to growth inhibition by the synthetic glucocorticoid fluocinolone acetonide (FA). DMI inhibited cell proliferation in a time-dependent manner. The translocation of GR was induced by FA alone, DMI alone, and combination of both agents. FA induced GR-mediated transcription in Ca3/7 cells transfected with a luciferase reporter gene under the control of glucocorticoid response element (GRE), but DMI alone did not affect GR-mediated transcription. However, DMI inhibited FA-induced, GR-mediated transcription when both agents were given together. Pretreatment with DMI followed by combination of DMI and FA decreased GR-mediated transcription more than pretreatment with FA. The expression of metallothionein-1 (Mt-1) gene, which is regulated by GR, was induced significantly by the combination of DMI and FA, and enhanced significantly by pretreatment with FA but not DMI. DMI is suggested to inhibit the growth of Ca3/7 cells and to affect GR-mediated transcription. </text>

      <text>[Quantitative analysis of regional cerebral blood flow in elderly with white matter lesions]. OBJECTIVE: To observe whether the severity of white matter lesions (WML) is related to ischemia in elderly. METHODS: WML were divided into 2 categories (centrum semiovale and periventricular regions) and four grades (grade 0, grade 1, grade 2 and grade 3) according to the severity of WML showing on the FLAIR sequence of MRI using modified Fazekas scale. The values of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) within WML and other brain regions were measured using Xenon contrast CT. RESULTS: Mean rCBF (ml x 100 g(-1) x min(-1)) within lesions around periventricular areas, in right and left centrum semiovale were 20.8 +/- 2.8, 22.3 +/- 1.9 and 22.2 +/- 2.1 in grade 0; 20.3 +/- 2.5, 21.3 +/- 1.0 and 21.0 +/- 1.8 in grade1; 16.3 +/- 2.0, 15.6 +/- 1.7 and 15.9 +/- 0.9 in grade 2; 14.1 +/- 2.6, 14.5 +/- 2.2 and 14.2 +/- 1.9 in grade 3 respectively. The severity of WML is associated significantly with reduction of rCBF within lesions both in centrum semiovale and periventricular regions (all P &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference in rCBF values between grade 0 and 1, but significant differences existed between grade 0 and grades 2 and 3, between grade 1 and grades 2 and 3 (all P &lt; 0.05). Statistical significance also existed between the severity of white matter lesions and rCBF in bilateral temporal lobes and lentiform nucleases (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The severity of WML both in centrum semiovale and periventricular regions is associated significantly with reduction of rCBF within lesions. </text>

      <text>MEK5/ERK5 signaling modulates endothelial cell migration and focal contact turnover. The formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones requires highly coordinated restructuring of endothelial cells (EC) and the surrounding extracellular matrix. Directed EC migration is a central step in this process and depends on cellular signaling cascades that initiate and control the structural rearrangements. On the basis of earlier findings that ERK5 deficiency in mouse EC results in massive defects in vessel architecture, we focused on the impact of the MEK5/ERK5 signaling pathway on EC migration. Using a retroviral gene transfer approach, we found that constitutive activation of MEK5/ERK5 signaling strongly inhibits EC migration and results in massive morphological changes. The area covered by spread EC was dramatically enlarged, accompanied by an increase in focal contacts and altered organization of actin filaments. Consequently, cells were more rigid and show reduced motility. This phenotype was most likely based on decreased focal contact turnover caused by reduced expression of p130Cas, a key player in directed cell migration. We demonstrate for the first time that ERK5 signaling not only is involved in EC survival and stress response but also controls migration and morphology of EC. </text>

      <text>[The prediction of the level of depression by cognitive, behavioral, and temperamental variables in a six-month time interval]. Several models have been proposed to explain the depressive phenomenon, such as the theory of dysfunctional attitudes, the hopelessness theory, the behavioral model of activity level, or temperamental models. This article presents data about the role of those models in the prediction of the level of depression in a sample of 414 college students, assessed over a temporal interval of six months. Dysfunctional attitudes, attributional styles, the level of activity, and the five-factors of personality were assessed. The BDI-II was the depression level measure. The results showed that these variables predict depression levels, but with low coefficients. The dimensions of Need of Achievement (a dysfunctional attitude) and Neuroticism had particularly greater weight in the prediction, but only Neuroticism seems to behave like a vulnerability element. Attributional styles did not contribute significantly to the prediction of depression. Activity level lost its predictive role during the 6-month interval. These results are discussed according to the role of the proposed models and the need for a deeper explanation of the variance of depression scores. </text>

      <text>EPOX inhibits angiogenesis by degradation of Mcl-1 through ERK inactivation. PURPOSE: Antiangiogenic therapy is considered as an effective strategy for controlling the growth and metastasis of tumors. Among a myriad of biological activities described for xanthone derivatives, the anticancer activity is quite remarkable, but the molecular mechanism is not clearly resolved. In the present study, we investigated the antiangiogenic mechanism of 3,6-di(2,3-epoxypropoxy)xanthone (EPOX), a novel Mcl-1 targeting drug. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To evaluate the antiangiogenic activity of EPOX, we did cell viability, cell cycle, tube formation assay in vitro, and Matrigel plug assay in vivo. To evaluate the effect of EPOX on the endothelial signaling pathway, we did immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence analysis. Intracellular glutathione levels were determined with the use of monochlorobimane, a glutathione-specific probe. RESULTS: EPOX induced endothelial cell apoptosis in association with proteasome-dependent Mcl-1 degradation. Down-regulation of Mcl-1 resulted in an increase in Mcl-1-free Bim, activation of Bax, and then signaling of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Additionally, glutathione depletion and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inactivation was observed in EPOX-treated cells. Glutathione supplementation reversed the inhibitory effects of EPOX on ERK, which increases the phosphorylation of Mcl-1 at T(163.) Overexpression of mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase (MEK) partially reversed the effect of EPOX on Mcl-1 dephosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation, further implicating ERK in the regulation of Mcl-1 stability. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that EPOX induces glutathione depletion, ERK inactivation, and Mcl-1 degradation on endothelial cells, which leads to inhibition of angiogenesis. Our results suggest that EPOX is a novel antiangiogenic agent, making it a promising lead compound for further development in the treatment of angiogenesis-related pathologies. </text>

      <text>Targeting angiogenesis: progress with anti-VEGF treatment with large molecules. Angiogenesis--one of the hallmarks of cancer--has emerged as a valid therapeutic target in oncology. The VEGF system represents a key mediator of tumor-initiated angiogenesis and the first target of antiangiogenesis agents introduced in clinical practice. Although anti-VEGF therapies have clearly demonstrated antitumor efficacy in various malignancies, especially when combined with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, their mechanism of action is not fully understood. This Review will discuss the rationale for using antiangiogenic compounds and will focus on large molecules, such as antibodies, that target the VEGF system. Clinical data on bevacizumab is discussed in detail. Predictive markers for anti-VEGF agents have not yet been identified and questions regarding the usefulness of bevacizumab in the adjuvant setting as well as its continued use beyond progression remain unanswered, in spite of negative data on bevacizumab in treating patients with adjuvant colon cancer. Nonetheless, anti-VEGF therapy has enhanced the arsenal of anticancer therapies and has provided new insights into the biology of malignancy. </text>

      <text>[Ambiguity role of neutrophils in oncogenesis] The review is focused on the participation of polymorphonuclear granulocytes (neutrophils) in development and spreading of a tumor. We consider both the well known functions of neutrophils (degranulation, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)) and the recently shown one (presentation of an antigene). The special attention is focused on the ambiguity of the neutrophil role in oncogenesis. The dominant view is that neutrophils display exclusively antitumor properties. The update information testifies about protumoral activity of neutrophils: they migrate to a tumor and promote angiogenesis and metastasis at late stages of the tumor. It is interesting that certain components of neutrophil cytotoxic arsenal (ROS, cytokines, specific enzymes) participate both in antitumoral defenses of an organism and protumoral activity. </text>

      <text>Endothelial cell migration and vascular endothelial growth factor expression are the result of loss of breast tissue polarity. Recruiting a new blood supply is a rate-limiting step in tumor progression. In a three-dimensional model of breast carcinogenesis, disorganized, proliferative transformed breast epithelial cells express significantly higher expression of angiogenic genes compared with their polarized, growth-arrested nonmalignant counterparts. Elevated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion by malignant cells enhanced recruitment of endothelial cells (EC) in heterotypic cocultures. Significantly, phenotypic reversion of malignant cells via reexpression of HoxD10, which is lost in malignant progression, significantly attenuated VEGF expression in a hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha-independent fashion and reduced EC migration. This was due primarily to restoring polarity: forced proliferation of polarized, nonmalignant cells did not induce VEGF expression and EC recruitment, whereas disrupting the architecture of growth-arrested, reverted cells did. These data show that disrupting cytostructure activates the angiogenic switch even in the absence of proliferation and/or hypoxia and restoring organization of malignant clusters reduces VEGF expression and EC activation to levels found in quiescent nonmalignant epithelium. These data confirm the importance of tissue architecture and polarity in malignant progression. </text>

      <text>Aging affects the cardiovascular responses to cold stress in humans. Cardiovascular-related mortality peaks during cold winter months, particularly in older adults. Acute physiological responses, such as increases in blood pressure, in response to cold exposure may contribute to these associations. To determine whether the blood pressure-raising effect (pressor response) of non-internal body temperature-reducing cold stress is greater with age, we measured physiological responses to 20 min of superficial skin cooling, via water-perfused suit, in 12 younger [25 +/- 1 (SE) yr old] and 12 older (65 +/- 2 yr old) adults. We found that superficial skin cooling elicited an increase in blood pressure from resting levels (pressor response; P &lt; 0.05) in younger and older adults. However, the magnitude of this pressor response (systolic and mean blood pressure) was more than twofold higher in older adults (P &lt; 0.05 vs. younger adults). The magnitude of the pressor response was similar at peripheral (brachial) and central (estimated in the aorta) measurement sites. Regression analysis revealed that aortic pulse wave velocity, a measure of central arterial stiffness obtained before cooling, was the best predictor of the increased pressor response to superficial skin cooling in older adults, explaining approximately 63% of its variability. These results indicate that there is a greater pressor response to non-internal body temperature-reducing cold stress with age in humans that may be mediated by increased levels of central arterial stiffness. </text>

      <text>Metronomic 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and irinotecan in colorectal cancer. Metronomic chemotherapy (the frequent, long term, low dose administration of chemotherapeutic drugs) is a promising therapy because it enhances the anti-endothelial activity of conventional chemotherapeutics, but with lower or no toxic effects compared to maximum tolerated dose administration. The aims of the present study were to compare, in vitro and in vivo, the antiangiogenic and antitumor activities of metronomic irinotecan (CPT-11), oxaliplatin (L-OHP) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in colorectal cancer and to investigate the metronomic combination of these drugs. In vitro cell proliferation, combination studies and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion analyses were performed on endothelial (HMVEC-d) and colorectal cancer (HT-29) cells exposed for 144 h to metronomic concentrations of SN-38, the active metabolite of CPT-11, L-OHP and 5-FU. HT-29 human colorectal cancer xenograft model was used and tumour growth, microvessel density and VEGF quantification were performed in tumours after the administration of metronomic CPT-11, L-OHP, 5-FU and their simultaneous combination. Low concentrations of SN-38, but not 5-FU and L-OHP, preferentially inhibited endothelial cell proliferation. Simultaneous and continuous exposure of HT-29 and HMVEC-d cells to low concentrations SN-38+L-OHP+5-FU for 144 h showed a strong antagonism and an unfavorable dose-reduction index. Moreover, the ternary combination resulted in a significant increase of VEGF secretion in HT-29 cancer cells. In a xenograft model metronomic CPT-11, but not 5-FU and L-OHP, significantly inhibits HT-29 tumor growth and microvessel density in the absence of toxicity. On the contrary, metronomic 5-FU+L-OHP+CPT-11 therapy did not affect the microvascular count. The metronomic concept might not universally apply to every cytotoxic drug in colorectal cancer and metronomic combination regimens should be used with caution. </text>

      <text>A key role for the integrin alpha2beta1 in experimental and developmental angiogenesis. The alpha2beta1 integrin receptor plays a key role in angiogenesis. Here we investigated the effects of small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) designed to disrupt integrin alpha2 I or beta1 I-like domain function on angiogenesis. In unchallenged endothelial cells, fibrillar collagen induced robust capillary morphogenesis. In contrast, tube formation was significantly reduced by SMI496, a beta1 I-like domain inhibitor and by function-blocking anti-alpha2beta1 but not -alpha1beta1 antibodies. Endothelial cells bound fluorescein-labeled collagen I fibrils, an interaction specifically inhibited by SMI496. Moreover, SMI496 caused cell retraction and cytoskeletal collapse of endothelial cells as well as delayed endothelial cell wound healing. SMI activities were examined in vivo by supplementing the growth medium of zebrafish embryos expressing green fluorescent protein under the control of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 promoter. SMI496, but not a control compound, interfered with angiogenesis in vivo by reversibly inhibiting sprouting from the axial vessels. We further characterized zebrafish alpha2 integrin and discovered that this integrin is highly conserved, especially the I domain. Notably, a similar vascular phenotype was induced by morpholino-mediated knockdown of the integrin alpha2 subunit. By live videomicroscopy, we confirmed that the vessels were largely nonfunctional in the absence of alpha2beta1 integrin. Collectively, our results provide strong biochemical and genetic evidence of a central role for alpha2beta1 integrin in experimental and developmental angiogenesis. </text>

      <text>[The value of intermittent ultrasound treatment in subacromial impingement syndrome]. OBJECTIVES: The role of intermittent ultrasound in the conservative treatment of subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) has not been clarified. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of ultrasound treatment in SIS. METHODS: Thirty-six patients (29 females, 7 males; mean age 51 years; range 40 to 69 years) with type II SIS were randomized to two groups to receive intermittent ultrasound (group 1, n=20) and placebo ultrasound (group 2, n=16) for three weeks (15 sessions). All the patients received the same standard physical therapy and rehabilitation modalities besides ultrasound treatment. Evaluations were made before and three and six weeks after treatment. Functional results were assessed by the Constant score, pain was assessed by a visual analog scale, and range of motion was measured. RESULTS: Within-group comparisons showed significant improvements in both groups three and six weeks after treatment (p&lt;0.05). Comparison between pretreatment and 6-week values were as follows: the mean flexion increased from 148.8+/-20.4 degrees to 175.6+/-6.0 degrees in group 1, and from 165.9+/-14.1 degrees to 177.4+/-4.4 degrees in group 2; internal and external rotation increased from 66.8+/-20.7 degrees and 61.9+/-22.9 degrees to 83.2+/-10.9 degrees and 84.4+/-9.6 degrees in group 1, and from 75.0+/-17.3 degrees and 70.0+/-19.8 degrees to 87.1+/-6.8 degrees and 84.6+/-8.4 degrees in group 2, respectively. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to the range of motion at the end of six weeks (p&gt;0.05). The Constant score improved from 43.7+/-12.9 to 65.7+/-7.7 in group 1, and from 43.9+/-16.4 to 65.3+/-7.6 in group 2. Pain scores decreased from 5.5 to 2 and from 5 to 1 in group 1 and 2, respectively. Improvements in Constant scores and pain scores were similar in both groups (p&gt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that intermittent ultrasound added to conservative treatment of SIS do not provide an additional benefit to the patients. </text>

      <text>Islet endothelial activation and oxidative stress gene expression is reduced by IL-1Ra treatment in the type 2 diabetic GK rat. BACKGROUND: Inflammation followed by fibrosis is a component of islet dysfunction in both rodent and human type 2 diabetes. Because islet inflammation may originate from endothelial cells, we assessed the expression of selected genes involved in endothelial cell activation in islets from a spontaneous model of type 2 diabetes, the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat. We also examined islet endotheliuml/oxidative stress (OS)/inflammation-related gene expression, islet vascularization and fibrosis after treatment with the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR on islets isolated from 10-week-old diabetic GK and control Wistar rats. Furthermore, GK rats were treated s.c twice daily with IL-1Ra (Kineret, Amgen, 100 mg/kg/day) or saline, from 4 weeks of age onwards (onset of diabetes). Four weeks later, islet gene analysis and pancreas immunochemistry were performed. Thirty-two genes were selected encoding molecules involved in endothelial cell activation, particularly fibrinolysis, vascular tone, OS, angiogenesis and also inflammation. All genes except those encoding angiotensinogen and epoxide hydrolase (that were decreased), and 12-lipoxygenase and vascular endothelial growth factor (that showed no change), were significantly up-regulated in GK islets. After IL-1Ra treatment of GK rats in vivo, most selected genes implied in endothelium/OS/immune cells/fibrosis were significantly down-regulated. IL-1Ra also improved islet vascularization, reduced fibrosis and ameliorated glycemia. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: GK rat islets have increased mRNA expression of markers of early islet endothelial cell activation, possibly triggered by several metabolic factors, and also some defense mechanisms. The beneficial effect of IL-1Ra on most islet endothelial/OS/immune cells/fibrosis parameters analyzed highlights a major endothelial-related role for IL-1 in GK islet alterations. Thus, metabolically-altered islet endothelium might affect the beta-cell microenvironment and contribute to progressive type 2 diabetic beta-cell dysfunction in GK rats. Counteracting islet endothelial cell inflammation might be one way to ameliorate/prevent beta-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes. </text>

      <text>Magnesium for treatment of asthma in children. QUESTION: Magnesium is considered adjuvant therapy for moderate to severe asthma exacerbations in adults, but can it be used to treat children? ANSWER: Magnesium seems to be beneficial in the treatment of moderate to severe asthma in children. It is a safe drug to administer, but there have been minor side effects reported, such as epigastric or facial warmth, flushing, pain and numbness at the infusion site, dry mouth, malaise, and hypotension. Owing to its bronchodilating and anti-inflammatory effects, magnesium is an encouraging adjuvant therapy for pediatric patients who do not respond to conventional treatment in acute severe exacerbations. Future studies should focus on establishing the optimal dosage for maximal benefits and the best route of administration. Magnesium should also be considered as a prophylactic treatment. </text>

      <text>AVE8062: a new combretastatin derivative vascular disrupting agent. Angiogenesis has an essential role in promoting and supporting tumor growth and it is an important therapeutic target. The tumor vascular network is the result of pro-angiogenic and inhibitory factors as well as of the interaction between endothelial cells and extracellular matrix. Different antiangiogenic therapeutics have been developed to improve tumor control through vascular-targeting agents (VTA). VTAs can be divided into two groups: antiangiogenic agents and vascular-disrupting agents (VDAs). VTAs inhibit specific factors required to induce and direct the angiogenic process, with major activity against small tumor masses and at the tumor periphery, encompassing monoclonal antibodies and small molecules inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase domain of the VEGF receptor. VDAs specifically target and destroy well-established tumor vessels with ischemia and destruction of large masses with central hemorrhagic necrosis and survival of a thin peripheral tumor layer. VDAs can be divided into biologics, such as ligand-based, and small-molecule agents; this second group includes small-molecule VDAs like flavonoids, such as 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA), and microtubule-destabilizing agents. In this review we will discuss the mechanism of action, as well as the preclinical and clinical results, of one of the most promising antitubulin agents: the combretastatin A4-phosphate derivative, AVE8062A. </text>

      <text>Targeting TNF for Treatment of Cancer and Autoimmunity. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was first isolated two decades ago as a macrophageproduced protein that can effectively kill tumor cells. TNF-alpha is also an essential component of the immune system and is required for hematopoiesis, for protection from bacterial infection and for immune cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Extensive research, however, has revealed that TNF-alpha is one of the major players in tumor initiation, proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. The proinflammatory activities link TNF-alpha with a wide variety of autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, diabetes and ankylosing spondylitis. Systemic inhibitors of TNF such as etanercept (Enbrel) (a soluble TNF receptor) and infliximab (Remicade) and adalimumab (Humira) (anti-TNF antibodies) have been approved for the treatment inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. These drugs, however, exhibit severe side effects and are expensive. Hence orally active blockers of TNF-alpha that are safe, efficacious and inexpensive are urgently needed. Numerous products from fruits, vegetable and traditional medicinal plants have been described which can suppress TNF expression and TNF signaling but their clinical potential is yet uncertain. </text>

      <text>[Effect of osteopontin silencing by lentivirus-mediated delivery of siRNA on glioma cell invasion and apoptosis].  OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of osteopontin silencing on the invasion and apoptosis of U251 cells. METHODS: The invasion, apoptosis and levels of uPA, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were determined by invasion assay, flow cytometry, Western blot and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR respectively. RESULTS: Osteopontin small interference RNA (siRNA) inhibited osteopontin expression and cell invasion, promoted apoptosis in U251 cells. In addition, the expression of Bcl-2, uPA, MMP-2 and MMP-9 was decreased, while Bax level was elevated. CONCLUSION: Osteopontin siRNA can inhibit U251 cells invasion via the down-regulation of uPA, MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels, and promote apoptosis through induction of Bax expression and inhibition of Bcl 2 level. It suggests that osteopontin plays an important role in human glioma progression. </text>

      <text>Magnitude of malate-aspartate reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide shuttle activity in intact respiring tumor cells. Measurements of respiration, CO2 and lactate production, and changes in the levels of various key metabolites of the glycolytic sequence and tricarboxylic acid cycle were made on five lines of rodent ascites tumor cells (two strains of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells, Krebs II carcinoma, AS-30D carcinoma, and L1210 cells) incubated aerobically in the presence of uniformly labeled D-[14C]glucose. From these data, as well as earlier evidence demonstrating that the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) shuttle in these cells requires a transaminase step and is thus identified as the malate-aspartate shuttle (W.V.V. Greenhouse and A.L. Lehninger, Cancer Res., 36: 1392-1396, 1976), metabolic flux diagrams were constructed for the five cell lines. These diagrams show the relative rates of glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, electron transport, and the malate-aspartate shuttle in these tumors. Large amounts of cytosolic NADH were oxidized by the mitochondrial respiratory chain via the NADH shuttle, comprising anywhere from about 20 to 80% of the total flow of reducing equivalents to oxygen in these tumors. Calculations of the sources of energy for adenosine triphosphate synthesis indicated that on the average about one-third of the respiratory adenosine triphosphate is generated by electron flow originating from cytosolic NADH via the malate-aspartate shuttle. </text>

      <text>AKT2 is a downstream target of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (Grm1).  We reported earlier on the oncogenic properties of Grm1 by demonstrating that stable Grm1-mouse-melanocytic clones proliferate in the absence of growth supplement and anchorage in vitro. In addition, these clones also exhibit aggressive tumorigenic phenotypes in vivo with short latency in tumor formation in both immunodeficient and syngeneic mice. We also detected strong activation of AKT in allograft tumors specifically AKT2 as the predominant isoform involved. In parallel, we assessed several human melanoma biopsy samples and found again that AKT2 was the predominantly activated AKT in these human melanoma biopsies. In cultured stable Grm1-mouse-melanocytic clones, as well as an metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (Grm1) expressing human melanoma cell line, C8161, stimulation of Grm1 by its agonist led to the activation of AKT, while preincubation with Grm1-antagonist abolished Grm1-agonist-induced AKT activation. In addition, a reduction in tumor volume of Grm1-mouse-melanocytic-allografts was detected in the presence of small interfering AKT2 RNA (siAKT2). Taken together, these results showed that, in addition to the MAPK pathway previously reported being a downstream target of stimulated Grm1, AKT2 is another downstream target in Grm1 mediated melanocyte transformation. </text>

      <text>Effectiveness of different approaches for establishing cisplatin-induced cochlear lesions in mice. CONCLUSIONS: Mouse cochleae are highly resistant to systemically administered cisplatin. However, cochlear lesions can be produced effectively in mice when cisplatin is applied locally through the round window niche or tympanum. OBJECTIVE: To explore the optimal approach for creating cisplatin-induced cochlear lesions in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cisplatin was administered to adult C57BL/6J mice via four approaches: (1) transtympanic injection, (2) round window niche injection, (3) intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) at 4 mg/kg/day for 4 consecutive days, and (4) one 15 mg/kg dose i.p. The hearing was monitored using frequency-specific auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). Cochlear pathology was observed in cochleograms with Harris' hematoxylin staining. RESULTS: Cisplatin applied systemically did not cause any significant ABR threshold elevation across the frequencies tested (2-32 kHz), whereas local application of cisplatin through the round window niche or tympanum resulted in significant ABR threshold elevations from high to medium frequencies. The functional changes were consistent with the cochlear pathology across groups. </text>

      <text>[Reconstruction of hepatic artery in adult to adult living donor liver transplantation in 104 patients]. OBJECTIVE: To report the experience of hepatic artery reconstruction with adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation (ALDLT) using right lobe liver grafts. METHODS: From January 2002 to August 2007, 104 patients underwent ALDLT using right lobe grafts. Hepatic arteries of donors and recipients were assessed carefully with spiral CT angiography and DSA before ALDLT. All patients underwent reconstruction of hepatic artery between right lobe liver grafts of donor and recipient which included the anastomosis between right hepatic artery of donors and recipients; the reconstruction of right hepatic artery between donor grafts and left hepatic artery of recipients; interpositional bypass using autogenous saphenous vein and cryopreserved iliac artery between right hepatic artery of donors and hepatic artery, common hepatic artery and abdominal aorta of recipients. The microsurgical technique was employed under the magnification of 3.5 times and operative microscope of 5-10 times. RESULTS: In these series, HAT occurred in 2 recipients at Days 1 and 7 post-ALDLT (1.9%). Both were revascularized with autogenous saphenous vein between right hepatic artery of donor and abdominal aorta of recipient. HAT occurred in 1 recipient at Days 90 post-ALDLT, but no symptom was presented. There was no severe complication and mortality related to hepatic artery reconstruction in recipients. No HAT, hepatic artery stenosis and aneurysm occurred during the follow-up period of 2-60 months. The 1, 2 and 3-year survival rates were 89.3%, 76.0% and 69.3% respectively. CONCLUSION: Careful evaluation of hepatic artery condition and using microsurgical techniques are important for safer arterial reconstruction and a long-term patency of hepatic artery in living donor liver transplantation in adults using right lobe liver grafts. </text>

      <text>Hormonal regulation and distinct functions of semaphorin-3B and semaphorin-3F in ovarian cancer.  Semaphorins comprise a family of molecules that influence neuronal growth and guidance. Class-3 semaphorins, semaphorin-3B (SEMA3B) and semaphorin-3F (SEMA3F), illustrate their effects by forming a complex with neuropilins (NP-1 or NP-2) and plexins. We examined the status and regulation of semaphorins and their receptors in human ovarian cancer cells. A significantly reduced expression of SEMA3B (83 kDa), SEMA3F (90 kDa), and plexin-A3 was observed in ovarian cancer cell lines when compared with normal human ovarian surface epithelial cells. The expression of NP-1, NP-2, and plexin-A1 was not altered in human ovarian surface epithelial and ovarian cancer cells. The decreased expression of SEMA3B, SEMA3F, and plexin-A3 was confirmed in stage 3 ovarian tumors. The treatment of ovarian cancer cells with luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and estrogen induced a significant upregulation of SEMA3B, whereas SEMA3F was upregulated only by estrogen. Cotreatment of cell lines with a hormone and its specific antagonist blocked the effect of the hormone. Ectopic expression of SEMA3B or SEMA3F reduced soft-agar colony formation, adhesion, and cell invasion of ovarian cancer cell cultures. Forced expression of SEMA3B, but not SEMA3F, inhibited viability of ovarian cancer cells. Overexpression of SEMA3B and SEMA3F reduced focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation and matrix metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression in ovarian cancer cells. Forced expression of SEMA3F, but not SEMA3B in ovarian cancer cells, significantly inhibited endothelial cell tube formation. Collectively, our results suggest that the loss of SEMA3 expression could be a hallmark of cancer progression. Furthermore, gonadotropin- and/or estrogen-mediated maintenance of SEMA3 expression could control ovarian cancer angiogenesis and metastasis. </text>

      <text>Tobacco smoke promotes lung tumorigenesis by triggering IKKbeta- and JNK1-dependent inflammation.  Chronic exposure to tobacco smoke, which contains over 60 tumor-initiating carcinogens, is the major risk factor for development of lung cancer, accounting for a large portion of cancer-related deaths worldwide. It is well established that tobacco smoke is a tumor initiator, but we asked whether it also acts as a tumor promoter once malignant initiation, such as caused by K-ras activation, has taken place. Here we demonstrate that repetitive exposure to tobacco smoke promotes tumor development both in carcinogen-treated mice and in transgenic mice undergoing sporadic K-ras activation in lung epithelial cells. Tumor promotion is due to induction of inflammation that results in enhanced pneumocyte proliferation and is abrogated by IKKbeta ablation in myeloid cells or inactivation of JNK1. </text>

      <text>Further Characterization of Activin A-induced IgA Response in Murine B Lymphocytes. We have recently shown that activin A, a member of TGF-beta superfamily, stimulates mouse B cells to express IgA isotype but other isotypes. In the present study, we further characterized effects of activin A on B cell growth and IgA expression. We found that activin A did not have effect on LPS-stimulated cell viability. In parallel, CFSE staining analysis revealed that activin A did not alter cell division. An increase of IgA secretion by activin A was completely abrogated by anti-activin A Ab but not by anti-TGFbeta1 Ab. In the same conditions, no other isotypes are significantly affected by each antibody treatment. Finally, activin A, as similar to TGF-beta1, increased IgA secretion by mesenteric lymph node cells. These results suggest that activin A can specifically stimulate IgA response, independent of TGF-beta in the gut. </text>

      <text>Posterior stabilization of the cervical spine with hook plates. Hook-plate fixation is designed for posterior cervical stabilization from C2 to C7. Indications remain the same as for standard posterior fixations. The prime indications are discoligamentous injuries. The plates are hooked under the lower laminas and attached to the articular masses of the upper vertebra by oblique screws. An H-graft is placed between the spinous processes. The vertebrae are compressed together by the plates at three points, the facet joints, and graft. The resulting pre-stressed system is stable in all directions. A protocol for safe reduction of cervical dislocations is observed. Of 70 patients treated from 1979 to 1986, 51 were examined 12-54 months after surgery. All fusions consolidated. Two neurologic complications not attributable to the fixation occurred. Other major complications were not seen. </text>

      <text>Dose- and time-dependent effects of doxorubicin on cytotoxicity, cell cycle and apoptotic cell death in human colon cancer cells.  The cytostatic drug doxorubicin is a well-known chemotherapeutic agent which is used in treatment of a wide variety of cancers. A key factor in the response of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs is the activation of the apoptotic pathway, a pathway that is often impaired in chemoresistant colon cancer cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of doxorubicin in Hct-116 human colon carcinoma cells in order to clarify if a time/concentration range for optimal doxorubicin-induced apoptosis exists. We compared a treatment schedule were cells were bolus incubated for 3h with doxorubicin followed by 24h in drug-free medium, with a continuous doxorubicin treatment schedule for 24h. Bolus incubation was carried out to determine effects of doxorubicin accumulated during the first 3h, whereas continuous incubation allowed further (continuous) exposure to doxorubicin. We found that bolus (3h) treatment with doxorubicin resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of viable cells and concomitant increase of apoptosis. Additionally, bolus (3h) doxorubicin incubation led to phosphorylation of p53 at serine 392, induction of p21, G2 arrest and increase of proapoptotic protein Bax. In contrast, continuous (24h) treatment with doxorubicin reduced the number of living cells with no parallel raise in the amount of dead cells. Continuous (24h) treatment with 5 microM doxorubicin resulted in cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase that was neither accompanied by phosphorylation and activation of p53 nor enhanced expression of p21. These results suggest that doxorubicin is able to induce cell death by apoptosis only at particular dose and treatment conditions and imply a completely different cellular response following bolus or continuous exposure to doxorubicin. </text>

      <text>Lactate-dehydrogenase 5 is overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer and correlates with the expression of the transketolase-like protein 1. AIMS: As one of the five lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoenzymes, LDH5 has the highest efficiency to catalyze pyruvate transformation to lactate. LDH5 overexpression in cancer cells induces an upregulated glycolytic metabolism and reduced dependence on the presence of oxygen. Here we analyzed LDH5 protein expression in a well characterized large cohort of primary lung cancers in correlation to clinico-pathological data and its possible impact on patient survival. METHODS: Primary lung cancers (n = 269) and non neoplastic lung tissue (n = 35) were tested for LDH5 expression by immunohistochemistry using a polyclonal LDH5 antibody (ab53010). The results of LDH5 expression were correlated to clinico-pathological data as well as to patient's survival. In addition, the results of the previously tested transketolase like 1 protein (TKTL1) expression were correlated to LDH5 expression. RESULTS: 89.5% (n = 238) of NSCLC revealed LDH5 expression whereas LDH5 expression was not detected in non neoplastic lung tissues (n = 34) (p &lt; 0.0001). LDH5 overexpression was associated with histological type (adenocarcinoma = 57%, squamous cell carcinoma = 45%, large cell carcinoma = 46%, p = 0.006). No significant correlation could be detected with regard to TNM-stage, grading or survival. A two sided correlation between the expression of TKTL1 and LDH5 could be shown (p = 0.002) within the overall cohort as well as for each grading and pN group. A significant correlation between LDH5 and TKTL1 within each histologic tumortype could not be revealed. CONCLUSIONS: LDH5 is overexpressed in NSCLC and could hence serve as an additional marker for malignancy. Furthermore, LDH5 correlates positively with the prognostic marker TKTL1. Our results confirm a close link between the two metabolic enzymes and indicate an alteration in the glucose metabolism in the process of malignant transformation. </text>

      <text>Is the elimination of HIV infection within reach in the United States? Lessons from an epidemiologic transmission model. Recent estimates show that the transmission rate of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the U.S. has substantially decreased. This raises the question, is elimination of HIV infection in the nation feasible in the foreseeable future? We demonstrate that if the HIV transmission rate were reduced by 50%, then the reproductive rate of HIV infection would drop below unity and lead to eventual elimination of infection. In recent congressional testimony, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others asserted that the HIV transmission rate can be halved by 2020, if not earlier, provided sufficient investment is made toward achieving this goal. We assert that if adequate investment is made and the transmission rate is in fact lowered by 50%, then the HIV reproductive rate would fall below unity, setting the stage for eventual elimination of HIV infection in the U.S. </text>

      <text>Pain assessment by continuous EEG: association between subjective perception of tonic pain and peak frequency of alpha oscillations during stimulation and at rest. Recordings of neurophysiological brain responses to noxious stimuli have been traditionally based on short stimuli, in the order of milliseconds, which induce distinct event-related potentials (ERPs). However, using such stimuli in the experimental setting is disadvantageous as they are too brief to faithfully simulate clinical pain. We aimed at utilizing continuous EEG to investigate the properties of peak alpha frequency (PAF) as an objective cortical measure associated with subjective perception of tonic pain. Five minute long continuous EEG was recorded in 18 healthy volunteers under: (i) resting-state; (ii) innocuous temperature; and (iii) psychophysically-anchored noxious temperature. Numerical pain scores (NPSs) collected during the application of tonic noxious stimuli were tested for correlation with peak frequencies of alpha power-curves derived from central, temporal and frontal electrodes. NPSs and PAFs remained stable throughout the recording conditions (RM-ANOVAs; Ps&gt;0.51). In the noxious condition, PAFs obtained at the bilateral temporal scalp were correlated with NPSs (Ps&lt;0.001). Moreover, resting-state PAFs recorded at the bilateral temporal scalp were correlated with NPSs reported during the noxious condition (Ps&lt;0.01). These psychophysical-neurophysiological relations attest to the properties of PAF as a novel cortical objective measure of subjective perception of tonic pain. Moreover, resting-state PAFs might hold inherent pain modulation attributes, possibly enabling the prediction of individual responsiveness to prolonged pain. The relevance of PAF to the neural processing of tonic pain may indicate its potential to advance pain research as well as clinical pain characterization. </text>

      <text>Acoustic trauma evokes hyperactivity and changes in gene expression in guinea-pig auditory brainstem. Hearing loss from acoustic trauma is a risk factor for tinnitus. Animal models using acoustic trauma have demonstrated hyperactivity in central auditory pathways, which has been suggested as a substrate for tinnitus. We used a guinea-pig model of unilateral acoustic trauma. Within the same animals, measurements of peripheral hearing loss, spontaneous activity of single neurons in the inferior colliculus and gene expression in cochlear nucleus and inferior colliculus were combined, acutely and after recovery from acoustic trauma. Genes investigated related to inhibitory (GABA-A receptor subunit alpha 1; glycine receptor subunit alpha 1) and excitatory neurotransmission (glutamate decarboxylase 1; glutamate receptor AMPA subunit alpha 2; glutamate receptor NMDA subunit 1), regulation of transmitter release (member of RAB family of small GTPase; RAB3 GTPase activating protein subunit 1) and neuronal excitability (potassium channel subfamily K member 15). Acoustic trauma resulted in unilateral hearing loss and hyperactivity bilaterally in inferior colliculus. Changes in expression of different mRNAs were observed in ipsilateral cochlear nucleus and in ipsi- and contralateral inferior colliculus, immediately after acoustic trauma, and after 2 and 4 weeks' recovery. Gene expression was generally reduced immediately after trauma, followed by a return to near normal levels or over-expression as recovery time increased. Different mechanisms appear to underlie the spontaneous hyperactivity observed. There is evidence of down-regulation of genes associated with neuronal inhibition in the contralateral inferior colliculus, whereas in ipsilateral cochlear nucleus, competing actions of inhibitory and excitatory systems seem to play a major role in determining overall excitability. </text>

      <text>Telomere/telomerase interplay in virus-driven and virus-independent lymphomagenesis: pathogenic and clinical implications.  Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex critically involved in extending and maintaining telomeres. Unlike the majority of somatic cells, in which hTERT and telomerase activity are generally silent, normal lymphocytes show transient physiological hTERT expression and telomerase activity according to their differentiation/activation status. During lymphomagenesis, induction of persistent telomerase expression and activity may occur before or after telomere shortening, as a consequence of the different mechanisms through which transforming factors/agents may activate telomerase. Available data indicate that the timing of telomerase activation may allow the distinction of two different lymphomagenetic models: (i) an early activation of telomerase via exogenous regulators of hTERT, along with an increased lymphocyte growth and a subsequent selection of cells with increased transforming potential may characterize several virus-related lymphoid malignancies; (ii) a progressive shortening of telomeres, leading to genetic instability which favors a subsequent activation of telomerase via endogenous regulators may occur in most virus-unrelated lymphoid tumors. These models may have clinically relevant implications, particularly for the tailoring of therapeutic strategies targeting telomerase. </text>

      <text>Yellow-green 52.3W laser at 556nm based on frequency doubling of a diode side-pumped Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. We demonstrate a high-power 556nm yellow-green laser generated by intracavity frequency doubling of a diode side-pumped Nd:YAG laser at 1112nm. A symmetrical L-shaped flat-flat cavity was employed to implement efficient operation of the low-gain 1112nm transition and to achieve good power scalability. The coatings of the cavity mirrors were carefully designed to optimize the performance of the laser, and a 92W continuous wave laser output at 1112nm was achieved when the pumping power of the laser diodes reached 960W. By intracavity frequency doubling of the fundamental laser in a lithium triborate crystal, the maximum power of the frequency-doubled output at 556nm was found to be as high as 52.3W with a pulse repetition frequency of 10kHz. This corresponds to an optical-to-optical conversion efficiency of about 5.4%. </text>

      <text>Betulin induces mitochondrial cytochrome c release associated apoptosis in human cancer cells.  We examined whether betulin, a naturally abundant compound, has anticancer functions in human cancer cells. The results showed that betulin significantly inhibited cell viability in cervix carcinoma HeLa cells, hepatoma HepG2 cells, lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, and breast cancer MCF-7 cells with IC(50) values ranging from 10 to 15 microg/mL. While betulin exhibited only moderate anticancer activity in other human cancer cells such as hepatoma SK-HEP-1 cells, prostate carcinoma PC-3, and lung carcinoma NCI-H460, with IC(50) values ranging from 20 to 60 microg/mL, it showed minor growth inhibition in human erythroleukemia K562 cells (IC(50) &gt; 100 microg/mL). We further investigated the mechanism of anticancer activity by betulin, using HeLa cells as an experimental model. Betulin (10 microg/mL) induces apoptotic cell death, as evidenced by morphological characteristics such as membrane phosphatidylserine translocation, nuclear condensation/fragmentation, and apoptotic body formation. A kinetics analysis showed that the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c occurred as early as 30 min after treatment with betulin. Betulin, unlike its chemical derivative betulinic acid, did not directly trigger mitochondrial cytochrome c release in isolated mitochondria. Importantly, Bax and Bak were rapidly translocated to the mitochondria 30 min after betulin treatment. The sequential activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3/-7 and the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were observed behind those mitochondrial events. Furthermore, specific downregulation of either caspase-9, Bax, or Bak by siRNA effectively reduced PARP cleavage and caspase-3 activation. Taken together, the lines of evidence demonstrate that betulin triggers apoptosis of human cancer cells through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. </text>

      <text>Structure of human hemoglobin messenger RNA and its relation to hemoglobinopathies. 1. One-fifth to 1/4 of globin mRNA is untranslated sequence other than polyadenylic acid. 2. The untranslated sequences of mRNA vary markedly in their sequence and in their length. 3. Globin mRNAs demonstrate a marked bias in codon selection. 4. Viral mRNA shows a quite different pattern of codon selection; therefore, the selection of codons is not uniform for all mRNAs functioning in animal cells. 5. Elongated hemoglobin chains can be accounted for by frame-shift mutations, or point mutations within the normal termination codon. The additional amino acids are then coded for by sequences that are normally untranslated. 6. Certain hemoglobin deletion mutants occur at sites where there are partially reiterated sequences within the heomoglobin messenger RNA. </text>

      <text>Ventral and dorsal striatal dopamine efflux and behavior in rats with simple vs. co-morbid histories of cocaine sensitization and neonatal ventral hippocampal lesions. UNLABELLED: RATIONAL: Exposing animal models of mental illness to addictive drugs provides an approach to understanding the neural etiology of dual diagnosis disorders. Previous studies have shown that neonatal ventral hippocampal lesions (NVHL) in rats produce features of both schizophrenia and addiction vulnerability. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated ventral and dorsal striatal dopamine (DA) efflux in NVHL rats combined with behavioral sensitization to cocaine. METHODS: Adult NVHL vs. SHAM-operated rats underwent a 5-day injection series of cocaine (15 mg/kg/day) vs. saline. One week later, rats were cannulated in nucleus accumbens SHELL, CORE, or caudate-putamen. Another week later, in vivo microdialysis sampled DA during locomotor testing in which a single cocaine injection (15 mg/kg) was delivered. RESULTS: NVHLs and cocaine history significantly increased behavioral activation approximately 2-fold over SHAM-saline history rats. DA efflux curves corresponded time dependently with the cocaine injection and locomotor curves and varied significantly by striatal region: Baseline DA levels increased 5-fold while cocaine-stimulated DA efflux decreased by half across a ventral to dorsal striatal gradient. However, NVHLs, prior cocaine history, and individual differences in behavior were not underpinned by differential DA efflux overall or within any striatal region. CONCLUSION: Differences in ventral/dorsal striatal DA efflux are not present in and are not required for producing differential levels of acute cocaine-induced behavioral activation in NVHLs with and without a behaviorally sensitizing cocaine history. These findings suggest other neurotransmitter systems, and alterations in striatal network function post-synaptic to DA transmission are more important to understanding the interactive effects of addictive drugs and mental illness. </text>

      <text>Adenovirus 5 E1A enhances histone deacetylase inhibitors-induced apoptosis through Egr-1-mediated Bim upregulation.  Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are potent anti-cancer agents for variety of cancer types. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) has been approved as a drug to treat cutaneous T cell lymphoma, and the combination of HDACi and other agents have been actively tested in many clinical trials. Adenovirus 5 early region 1A (E1A) has been shown to exhibit high tumor suppressor activity, and gene therapy using E1A has been tested in clinical trials. Here, we showed that proapoptotic activity of HDACi was robustly enhanced by E1A in multiple cancer cells, but not in normal cells. Moreover, we showed that combination of E1A gene therapy and SAHA showed high therapeutic efficacy with low toxicity in vivo ovarian and breast xenograft models. SAHA downregulated Bcl-XL and upregulated proapoptotic BH3-only protein Bim, whose expression was further enhanced by E1A in cancer cells. These alterations of Bcl-2 family proteins were critical for apoptosis induced by the combination in cancer cells. SAHA enhanced acetylation of histone H3 in Bim promoter region, while E1A upregulated Egr-1, which was directly involved in Bim transactivation. Together, our results provide not only a novel insight into the mechanisms underlying anti-tumor activity of E1A, but also a rationale for the combined HDACi and E1A gene therapy in future clinical trials. </text>

      <text>Using a web-based orthopaedic clinic in the curricular teaching of a German university hospital: analysis of learning effect, student usage and reception. PURPOSE: Modern teaching concepts for undergraduate medical students in Germany include problem based learning as a major component of the new licensing regulations for physicians. Here we describe the usage of a web-based virtual outpatient clinic in the teaching curriculum of undergraduate medical students, its effect on learning success, and student reception. METHODS: Fifth year medial students were requested to examine 7 virtual orthopaedic patients which had been created by the authors using the Inmedea-Simulator. They also had to take a multiple-choice examination on two different occasions and their utilisation of the simulator was analysed subjectively and objectively. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty students took part in the study. The average age was 24.9 years, 60% were female. Most of the participants studied on their own using their private computer with a fast internet-connection at home. The average usage time was 263 min, most of the students worked with the system in the afternoon, although a considerable number used it late in the night. Regarding learning success, we found that the examination results were significantly better after using the system (7.66 versus 8.37, p&lt;0.0001). Eighty percent of the students enjoyed dealing with the virtual patients emphasizing the completeness of patient cases, the artistic graphic design and the expert comments available, as well as the good applicability to real cases. Eighty-seven percent of the students graded the virtual orthopaedic clinic as appropriate to teach orthopaedic content. CONCLUSION: Using the Inmedea-Simulator is an effective method to enhance students' learning efficacy. The way the system was used by the students emphasises the advantages of the internet-like free time management and the implementation of multimedia-based content. </text>

      <text>Constitutively nuclear FOXO3a localization predicts poor survival and promotes Akt phosphorylation in breast cancer.  BACKGROUND: The PI3K-Akt signal pathway plays a key role in tumorigenesis and the development of drug-resistance. Cytotoxic chemotherapy resistance is linked to limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Examination of FOXO3a and phosphorylated-Akt (P-Akt) expression in breast cancer tissue microarrays showed nuclear FOXO3a was associated with lymph node positivity (p = 0.052), poor prognosis (p = 0.014), and P-Akt expression in invasive ductal carcinoma. Using tamoxifen and doxorubicin-sensitive and -resistant breast cancer cell lines as models, we found that doxorubicin- but not tamoxifen-resistance is associated with nuclear accumulation of FOXO3a, consistent with the finding that sustained nuclear FOXO3a is associated with poor prognosis. We also established that doxorubicin treatment induces proliferation arrest and FOXO3a nuclear relocation in sensitive breast cancer cells. Induction of FOXO3a activity in doxorubicin-sensitive MCF-7 cells was sufficient to promote Akt phosphorylation and arrest cell proliferation. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous FOXO3a expression reduced PI3K/Akt activity. Using MDA-MB-231 cells, in which FOXO3a activity can be induced by 4-hydroxytamoxifen, we showed that FOXO3a induction up-regulates PI3K-Akt activity and enhanced doxorubicin resistance. However FOXO3a induction has little effect on cell proliferation, indicating that FOXO3a or its downstream activity is deregulated in the cytotoxic drug resistant breast cancer cells. Thus, our results suggest that sustained FOXO3a activation can enhance hyperactivation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Together these data suggest that lymph node metastasis and poor survival in invasive ductal breast carcinoma are linked to an uncoupling of the Akt-FOXO3a signaling axis. In these breast cancers activated Akt fails to inactivate and re-localize FOXO3a to the cytoplasm, and nuclear-targeted FOXO3a does not induce cell death or cell cycle arrest. As such, sustained nuclear FOXO3a expression in breast cancer may culminate in cancer progression and the development of an aggressive phenotype similar to that observed in cytotoxic chemotherapy resistant breast cancer cell models. </text>

      <text>Skin deep and deeper: multiple pathways in basal cell carcinogenesis.  This perspective places the report by Villani et al. that appears in this issue of the journal (beginning on page 1222) in the context of recent work showing an intersection between two important developmental pathways implicated in oncogenesis: the hedgehog and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathways. Villani et al. define a key role for the IGF regulatory protein Igfbp2 in a genetic model of basal cell carcinogenesis driven by targeted constitutive activation of hedgehog signaling. Placed in the framework of other recently published work, the observations of Villani et al. both raise questions about the cell of origin for basal cell cancers and define additional putative therapeutic and preventive targets for this disease. </text>

      <text>Brick1 is an essential regulator of actin cytoskeleton required for embryonic development and cell transformation.  Brick1 (Brk1) is the less-studied component of the Wave/Scar pathway involved in the branched nucleation of actin fibers. The clinical relevance of Brk1 is emphasized by correlative data showing that Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) patients that also lose the BRK1 gene are protected against the development of tumors. This contrasts with recent evidence suggesting that the Wave complex may function as an invasion suppressor in epithelial cancers. Here, we show that the downregulation of Brk1 results in abnormal actin stress fiber formation and vinculin distribution and loss of Arp2/3 and Wave proteins at the cellular protrusions. Brk1 is required for cell proliferation and cell transformation by oncogenes. In addition, Brk1 downregulation results in defective directional migration and invasive growth in renal cell carcinoma cells as well as in other tumor cell types. Finally, genetic ablation of Brk1 results in dramatic defects in embryo compaction and development, suggesting an essential role for this protein in actin dynamics. Thus, genetic loss or inhibition of BRK1 is likely to be protective against tumor development due to proliferation and motility defects in affected cells. </text>

      <text>Ras-association domain family 1C protein promotes breast cancer cell migration and attenuates apoptosis.  BACKGROUND: The Ras association domain family 1 (RASSF1) gene is a Ras effector encoding two major mRNA forms, RASSF1A and RASSF1C, derived by alternative promoter selection and alternative mRNA splicing. RASSF1A is a tumor suppressor gene. However, very little is known about the function of RASSF1C both in normal and transformed cells. METHODS: Gene silencing and over-expression techniques were used to modulate RASSF1C expression in human breast cancer cells. Affymetrix-microarray analysis was performed using T47D cells over-expressing RASSF1C to identify RASSF1C target genes. RT-PCR and western blot techniques were used to validate target gene expression. Cell invasion and apoptosis assays were also performed. RESULTS: In this article, we report the effects of altering RASSF1C expression in human breast cancer cells. We found that silencing RASSF1C mRNA in breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB231 and T47D) caused a small but significant decrease in cell proliferation. Conversely, inducible over-expression of RASSF1C in breast cancer cells (MDA-MB231 and T47D) resulted in a small increase in cell proliferation. We also report on the identification of novel RASSF1C target genes. RASSF1C down-regulates several pro-apoptotic and tumor suppressor genes and up-regulates several growth promoting genes in breast cancer cells. We further show that down-regulation of caspase 3 via overexpression of RASSF1C reduces breast cancer cells' sensitivity to the apoptosis inducing agent, etoposide. Furthermore, we found that RASSF1C over-expression enhances T47D cell invasion/migration in vitro. CONCLUSION: Together, our findings suggest that RASSF1C, unlike RASSF1A, is not a tumor suppressor, but instead may play a role in stimulating metastasis and survival in breast cancer cells. </text>

      <text>Role of stromal myofibroblasts in invasive breast cancer: stromal expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin correlates with worse clinical outcome.  BACKGROUND: Recently, the desmoplastic reaction has been implicated as having an important function in epithelial solid tumor biology. There have been no reports showing the relativity of invasive breast cancer and the desmoplastic reaction by a quantitative analysis of the myofibroblasts that were an important player in the desmoplastic reaction. The purpose of this study was to immunohistochemically investigate the correlation between the desmoplastic reaction and the clinicopathology of invasive breast cancer. METHODS: The study included 60 patients with a known prognosis of invasive breast cancer. We quantified the expression of alpha-SMA as a marker of myofibroblasts in the invasive breast cancer. After staining samples for alpha-SMA, their expression was extracted and quantified as a relative percentage by computer-assisted image analysis. RESULTS: There was relatively wide variation in the expression of alpha-SMA with the percentage of the area from 0.68 to 28.15% (mean 8.48 +/- 5.40%). The metastasis group showed significantly higher alpha-SMA expression compared with the no metastasis group (p &lt; 0.001). When the patients were divided into two groups according to their alpha-SMA expression using a cutoff point at the mean value of 8.48%, the high alpha-SMA group had a significantly poorer overall survival rate (p &lt; 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that alpha-SMA and lymph node metastasis were identified as independent predictive factors of metastasis. CONCLUSION: Myofibroblasts represent an important prognostic factor for invasive growth that is translated into a poor clinical prognosis for patients with invasive breast cancer. </text>

      <text>The disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domains of ADAM-9 mediate interactions between melanoma cells and fibroblasts.  A characteristic of malignant cells is their capacity to invade their surrounding and to metastasize to distant organs. During these processes, proteolytic activities of tumor and stromal cells modify the extracellular matrix to produce a microenvironment suitable for their growth and migration. In recent years the family of ADAM proteases has been ascribed important roles in these processes. ADAM-9 is expressed in human melanoma at the tumor-stroma border where direct or indirect interactions between tumor cells and fibroblasts occur. To analyze the role of ADAM-9 for the interaction between melanoma cells and stromal fibroblasts, we produced the recombinant disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domain of ADAM-9 (DC-9). Melanoma cells and human fibroblasts adhered to immobilized DC-9 in a Mn(2+)-dependent fashion suggesting an integrin-mediated process. Inhibition studies showed that adhesion of fibroblasts was mediated by several beta1 integrin receptors independent of the RGD and ECD recognition motif. Furthermore, interaction of fibroblasts and high invasive melanoma cells with soluble recombinant DC-9 resulted in enhanced expression of MMP-1 and MMP-2. Silencing of ADAM-9 in melanoma cells significantly reduced cell adhesion to fibroblasts. Ablation of ADAM-9 in fibroblasts almost completely abolished these cellular interactions and melanoma cell invasion in vitro. In summary, these results suggest that ADAM-9 expression plays an important role in mediating cell-cell contacts between fibroblasts and melanoma cells and that these interactions contribute to proteolytic activities required during invasion of melanoma cells. </text>

      <text>Emerging metabolic targets in cancer therapy. Cancer cells are different from normal cells in their metabolic properties. Normal cells mostly rely on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to produce energy. In contrast, cancer cells depend mostly on glycolysis, the aerobic breakdown of glucose into ATP. This altered energy dependency is known as the "Warburg effect" and is a hallmark of cancer cells. In recent years, investigating the metabolic changes within cancer cells has been a rapidly growing area. Emerging evidence shows that oncogenes that drive the cancer-promoting signals also drive the altered metabolism. Although the exact mechanisms underlying the Warburg effect are unclear, the existing evidence suggests that increased glycolysis plays an important role in support malignant behavior of cancer cells. A thorough understanding of the unique metabolism of cancer cells will help to design of more effective drugs targeting metabolic pathways, which will greatly impact the capacity to effectively treat cancer patients. Here we provide an overview of the current understanding of the Warburg effect upon tumor cell growth and survival, and discussion on the potential metabolic targets for cancer therapy. </text>

      <text>MTSS1: a multifunctional protein and its role in cancer invasion and metastasis.  MTSS1 (metastasis suppressor-1) was first identified as a metastasis suppressor missing in metastatic bladder carcinoma cell lines. The down-regulation of MTSS1 that may be caused by DNA methylation was also observed in many other types of cancer. While accumlating evidence for the function of MTSS1 support the concept that it is unlikely to be a metastasis suppressor, but actually acts as a scaffold protein that interacts with multiple partners to regulate actin dynamics. It has also been demonstrated that MTSS1 is involved in the Shh signaling pathway in the developing hair follicle and in basal cell carcinomas of the skin. Such evidence indicates that MTSS1 as a multiple functional molecular player and has an important role in development, carcinogenesis and metastasis. However, the biochemical mechanisms by which MTSS1 functions in cells and the physiological role of this protein in animals remain largely unknown. In this review, we will discuss the current knowledge of MTSS1's role in cancer metastasis, carcinogenesis, and development. The clinical significance of MTSS1 will also be discussed. </text>

      <text>Ras p21 onco-protein in the sera of mice carrying an experimentally induced tumor and in human cancer patients.  We have established a model system to detect the presence of ras p21 in the sera of Balb/c mice carrying tumors induced by a mouse cell line transformed with the Harvey murine sarcoma virus in the presence of a helper Friend murine leukemia virus. As determined by ELISA and immunoblot assays, ras p21 in the serum increased with increased tumor growth. Since ras genes have been found to be frequently activated in human tumours, we examined the levels of ras p21 in the sera of a variety of human cancer patients. In only 3 out of 13 cases, representing patients with adenocarcinomas of the stomach receiving chemotherapy, was ras p21 detected at elevated levels, whereas in patients with the following types of cancer no substantial change in serum ras p21 was observed; nine with breast, 5 colon, 5 lung, 5 ovarian and 5 hepatocellular carcinomas. </text>

      <text>Serum soluble vascular adhesion protein-1 is a valuable prognostic marker in gastric cancer.  BACKGROUND: Vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) regulates leukocyte tissue infiltration. Elevated serum soluble VAP-1 (sVAP-1) levels occur in certain diseases having an inflammatory component. We previously showed in colorectal cancer that sVAP-1 expression is significantly higher relative to controls, and this decreased expression is associated with poor prognosis and lymph node and liver metastasis. However, sVAP-1 expression has not been described for gastric cancer. This study determines the relationship between preoperative serum sVAP-1 levels and clinicopathological features and prognosis in gastric cancer. METHODS: Preoperative serum was collected from 107 gastric cancer patients and 33 normal controls. sVAP-1 levels were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The mean sVAP-1 level for cancer patients was significantly higher relative to controls, and decreased with disease progression. Tumor size, serosal invasion, lymph node metastasis, peritoneal dissemination, and TNM classification was significantly correlated with sVAP-1 level. sVAP-1 is also an independent predictive marker for lymph node metastasis. Patients having low sVAP-1 levels had significantly poorer prognosis relative to patients having elevated sVAP-1 in all or stages I-III gastric cancer patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Low sVAP-1 levels are associated with poor prognosis in gastric cancer. Determining sVAP-1 levels may be valuable for predicting prognosis and lymph node metastasis. </text>

      <text>Metabolic regulation by p53. We are increasingly aware that cellular metabolism plays a vital role in diseases such as cancer, and that p53 is an important regulator of metabolic pathways. By transcriptional activation and other means, p53 is able to contribute to the regulation of glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, glutaminolysis, insulin sensitivity, nucleotide biosynthesis, mitochondrial integrity, fatty acid oxidation, antioxidant response, autophagy and mTOR signalling. The ability to positively and negatively regulate many of these pathways, combined with feedback signalling from these pathways to p53, demonstrates the reciprocal and flexible nature of the regulation, facilitating a diverse range of responses to metabolic stress. Intriguingly, metabolic stress triggers primarily an adaptive (rather than pro-apoptotic) p53 response, and p53 is emerging as an important regulator of metabolic homeostasis. A better understanding of how p53 coordinates metabolic adaptation will facilitate the identification of novel therapeutic targets and will also illuminate the wider role of p53 in human biology. </text>

      <text>Use of DNA microarray and small animal positron emission tomography in preclinical drug evaluation of RAF265, a novel B-Raf/VEGFR-2 inhibitor.  Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has become a useful tool for assessing early biologic response to cancer therapy and may be particularly useful in the development of new cancer therapeutics. RAF265, a novel B-Raf/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 inhibitor, was evaluated in the preclinical setting for its ability to inhibit the uptake of PET tracers in the A375M(B-Raf(V600E)) human melanoma cell line. RAF265 inhibited 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-d-glucose (FDG) accumulation in cell culture at 28 hours in a dose-dependent manner. RAF265 also inhibited FDG accumulation in tumor xenografts after 1 day of drug treatment. This decrease persisted for the remaining 2 weeks of treatment. DNA microarray analysis of treated tumor xenografts revealed significantly decreased expression of genes regulating glucose and thymidine metabolism and revealed changes in apoptotic genes, suggesting that the imaging tracers FDG, 3-deoxy-3-[(18)F]fluorothymidine, and annexin V could serve as potential imaging biomarkers for RAF265 therapy monitoring. We concluded that RAF265 is highly efficacious in this xenograft model of human melanoma and decreases glucose metabolism as measured by DNA microarray analysis, cell culture assays, and small animal FDG PET scans as early as 1 day after treatment. Our results support the use of FDG PET in clinical trials with RAF265 to assess early tumor response. DNA microarray analysis and small animal PET studies may be used as complementary technologies in drug development. DNA microarray analysis allows for analysis of drug effects on multiple pathways linked to cancer and can suggest corresponding imaging tracers for further analysis as biomarkers of tumor response. </text>

      <text>Predictive value of serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 in malignant intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. BACKGROUND: The goal of the present study was to evaluate the predictive value of serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) in the diagnosis of malignant intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of pancreas (IPMNs). METHODS: Eighty-six patients with pathological diagnosis of IPMNs in Zhongshan Hospital between March 1999 and November 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. Data reflecting clinical characteristics, tumor marker level, and prognosis were collected. The potential predictive value of CA 19-9 was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: Eighty-six consecutive patients with IPMNs all underwent surgical intervention. A high level of CA 19-9 or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was associated with more advanced stage of malignant IPMNs. Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 was significant for judging malignant IPMNs in the binary logistic regression model (p=0.047). The hazard ratio was 1.014, whose 95.0% confidence interval was 0.91-1.028. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the serum CA 19-9 level had good predictive value for malignant or invasive IPMNs, postoperative survival, and disease-specific recurrence. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.856, 0.893, 0.815, and 0.857 (p&lt;0.05), respectively. According to the follow-up, mean survival time for groups with CA 19-9&gt;63.60 U/ml was dramatically shorter than that for groups with CA 19-9&lt;=63.60 U/ml (57.38+/-2.85 versus 29.24+/-5.82 [months]; p&lt;0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Serum CA 19-9 level has good predictive value for malignant or invasive IPMNs. Patients with CA 19-9 &gt; 63.60 U/ml had poor postoperative prognosis in IPMNs. Preoperative abnormal serum CA 19-9 might be predictive for an aggressive surgical intervention in IPMNs. </text>

      <text>Saliva proteins of vector Culicoides modify structure and infectivity of bluetongue virus particles. Bluetongue virus (BTV) and epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) are related orbiviruses, transmitted between their ruminant hosts primarily by certain haematophagous midge vectors (Culicoides spp.). The larger of the BTV outer-capsid proteins, 'VP2', can be cleaved by proteases (including trypsin or chymotrypsin), forming infectious subviral particles (ISVP) which have enhanced infectivity for adult Culicoides, or KC cells (a cell-line derived from C. sonorensis). We demonstrate that VP2 present on purified virus particles from 3 different BTV strains can also be cleaved by treatment with saliva from adult Culicoides. The saliva proteins from C. sonorensis (a competent BTV vector), cleaved BTV-VP2 more efficiently than those from C. nubeculosus (a less competent/non-vector species). Electrophoresis and mass spectrometry identified a trypsin-like protease in C. sonorensis saliva, which was significantly reduced or absent from C. nubeculosus saliva. Incubating purified BTV-1 with C. sonorensis saliva proteins also increased their infectivity for KC cells ~10 fold, while infectivity for BHK cells was reduced by 2-6 fold. Treatment of an 'eastern' strain of EHDV-2 with saliva proteins of either C. sonorensis or C. nubeculosus cleaved VP2, but a 'western' strain of EHDV-2 remained unmodified. These results indicate that temperature, strain of virus and protein composition of Culicoides saliva (particularly its protease content which is dependent upon vector species), can all play a significant role in the efficiency of VP2 cleavage, influencing virus infectivity. Saliva of several other arthropod species has previously been shown to increase transmission, infectivity and virulence of certain arboviruses, by modulating and/or suppressing the mammalian immune response. The findings presented here, however, demonstrate a novel mechanism by which proteases in Culicoides saliva can also directly modify the orbivirus particle structure, leading to increased infectivity specifically for Culicoides cells and, in turn, efficiency of transmission to the insect vector. </text>

      <text>Systematic proteomic analysis of human hepotacellular carcinoma cells reveals molecular pathways and networks involved in metastasis.  Systematic proteomic studying of the mechanism of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastasis remains challenging. We performed comparative proteomic and pathway analysis of four human metastatic HCC cell lines to identify metastasis-associated proteins. These HCC cell lines had a similar genetic background but with an increasing potential of metastasis. Using a combination of two dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, a total of 125 proteins and their post-translational modification forms or isoforms were found to be differentially expressed in the cell lines. Among them, 29 were gradually up-regulated whereas 17 were down-regulated with increasing metastatic potential. Instead of a traditional single-gene readout, global bioinformatics analysis was carried out, which revealed that the glycolysis pathway was the most significantly enriched pathway. The heat shock proteins (HSPs) centered and NF-kappaB centered networks were also enriched in the result, which may imply the key function of inflaming on metastasis. Meanwhile, knockdown of HDGF, an up-regulated protein and a target of NF-kappaB, induced cell apoptosis in the metastatic HCC cells. This work provides a demonstration that a combination of bioinformatics and comparative proteomics can help in finding out potential biomarkers associated with HCC metastasis on the level of pathways. </text>

      <text>Induction of Id-1 by FGF-2 involves activity of EGR-1 and sensitizes neuroblastoma cells to cell death.  Inhibitor of differentiation-1 (Id-1) is a member of helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of proteins that regulate gene transcription through their inhibitory binding to basic-HLH transcription factors. Similarly to other members of this family, Id-1 is involved in the repression of cell differentiation and activation of cell growth. The dual function of Id-1, inhibition of differentiation, and stimulation of cell proliferation, might be interdependent, as cell differentiation is generally coupled with the exit from the cell cycle. Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) has been reported to play multiple roles in different biological processes during development of the central nervous system (CNS). In addition, FGF-2 has been described to induce "neuronal-like" differentiation and trigger apoptosis in neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cells. Although regulation of Id-1 protein by several mitogenic factors is well-established, little is known about the role of FGF-2 in the regulation of Id-1. Using human neuroblastoma cell line, SK-N-MC, we found that treatment of these cells with FGF-2 resulted in early induction of both Id-1 mRNA and protein. The induction occurs within 1 h from FGF-2 treatment and is mediated by ERK1/2 pathway, which in turn stimulates expression of the early growth response-1 (Egr-1) transcription factor. We also demonstrate direct interaction of Egr-1 with Id-1 promoter in vitro and in cell culture. Finally, inhibition of Id-1 expression results in G(2) /M accumulation of FGF-2-treated cells and delayed cell death. </text>

      <text>Vimentin is preferentially expressed in human breast carcinomas with low estrogen receptor and high Ki-67 growth fraction.  Vimentin expression, growth fractions (GF), and estrogen receptor (ER) levels were determined for 90 untreated primary breast carcinomas. Coexpression of keratin and vimentin was found in approximately 20% of the tumors regardless of menopausal status. Vimentin was expressed preferentially in tumor cells of high-grade ductal breast carcinomas (15 of 28 histologic grade 3 vs. 0 of 40 grades 1 and 2). Vimentin expression was found preferentially in tumors with high GF (greater than 15% Ki-67 positive by immunoperoxidase staining) and low ER levels (less than 60 fmols/mg protein by a monoclonal enzyme immunoassay). Sixty-eight percent of tumors in this group were vimentin positive and 88% of all vimentin-positive tumors fell into this category. More than 50% of the tumor cells coexpressed vimentin and keratin. Thus, vimentin expression may be helpful in identifying a substantial subset of ER-independent breast carcinomas with poor prognostic indicators. </text>

      <text>Non-heart-beating organ donation in Italy. In 2007 the non-heart-beating organ donation (NHBD) "Programma Alba" (Sunrise Programme) started in Pavia, Italy. The initial plan was to cut down waiting list for kidney transplantation, while its final aim is to shorten organ transplantation waiting lists. When compared to European countries and the USA, the Italian NHBD program has taken longer to get established. Initially Italian physicians were not entirely aware of the NHBD organ viability for transplantation, furthermore ethical issues and the need to regulate medical requirements to Italian law slowed down the NHBD program. In particular, Italian legislation provides for death ascertainment after irreversible cardiac arrest, 20-minute flat electrocardiogram. This no-touch period is longer when compared to worldwide legislation, and organ viability has been a main concern for Italian transplant doctors over the years. However, recent data let up to 40-minute warm ischemia time to preserve organ viability; this has encouraged Pavia's group to establish the NHBD "Programma Alba". It was designed according to Italian legislation from death diagnosis to graft placement, from this perspective must the significant role of the Transplant coordinator be recognized. Since 2007 seven kidneys have been gathered from seven NHBD. Of these, six NHBD kidneys have been transplanted. Currently, four patients are out of dialysis. This report is a detailed description of NHBD "Programma Alba" and its preliminary results. </text>

      <text>[Expression of Merlin protein in non-small cell lung carcinoma and the clinical significance].  OBJECTIVE: To determine the expression and clinical significance of Merlin protein in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: The expression of Merlin protein in 45 cases of NSCLC and adjacent tissue of NSCLC and normal lung tissue was checked by immunohistochemistry. The relation between the expression of Merlin protein and the multiple factors of pathological type, gender, P-TNM stage, differentiation and lymph node metastasis was analyzed. RESULTS: The expression rates of Merlin protein in NSCLC and normal lung tissue sections were 73.33% and 15.56%, respectively (P&lt;0.05). The expression of Merlin protein was not associated with the pathological type, gender, P-TNM stage, differentiation and lymph node metastasis (P&gt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Merlin protein might contribute to the initiation of metastasis of NSCLC. </text>

      <text>The members of an Epstein-Barr virus microRNA cluster cooperate to transform B lymphocytes.  Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transforms B lymphocytes through the expression of the latent viral proteins EBNA and latent membrane protein (LMP). Recently, it has become apparent that microRNAs (miRNAs) also contribute to EBV's oncogenic properties; recombinant EBVs that lack the BHRF1 miRNA cluster display a reduced ability to transform B lymphocytes in vitro. Furthermore, infected cells evince a marked upregulation of the EBNA genes. Using recombinant viruses that lack only one member of the cluster, we now show that all three BHRF1 miRNAs contribute to B-cell transformation. Recombinants that lacked miR-BHRF1-2 or miR-BHRF1-3 displayed enhanced EBNA expression initiated at the Cp and Wp promoters. Interestingly, we find that the deletion of miR-BHRF1-2 reduced the expression level of miR-BHRF1-3 and possibly that of miR-BHRF1-1, demonstrating that the expression of one miRNA can potentiate the expression of other miRNAs located in the same cluster. Therefore, the phenotypic traits of the miR-BHRF1-2 null mutant could result partly from reduced miR-BHRF1-1 and miR-BHRF1-3 expression levels. Nevertheless, using an miR-BHRF1-1 and miR-BHRF1-3 double mutant, we could directly assess and confirm the contribution of miR-BHRF1-2 to B-cell transformation. Furthermore, we found that the potentiating effect of miR-BHRF1-2 on miR-BHRF1-3 synthesis can be reproduced with simple expression plasmids, provided that both miRNAs are processed from the same transcript. Therefore, this enhancing effect does not result from an idiosyncrasy of the EBV genome but rather reflects a general property of these miRNAs. This study highlights the advantages of arranging the BHRF1 miRNAs in clusters: it allows the synchronous and synergistic expression of genetic elements that cooperate to transform their target cells. </text>

      <text>Massive osteolysis in a dog resembling Gorham's disease in humans. An eight-month-old mixed-breed dog was presented with a history of sudden onset pelvic limb lameness. Radiographic and computed tomographic examinations demonstrated an osteolytic process involving the lumbar spine and pelvis. A comprehensive work-up including serial radiographic skeletal survey, biopsy, routine laboratory investigation and evaluation of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels failed to reveal any underlying cause for the osteolysis. Conservative treatment using the bisphosphonate drug alendronate and oral analgesic medications resulted in a return to nearly normal long-term function, despite massive lumbar and pelvic osteolysis. The clinical, radiological and histopathological features in this dog are reported, and similarities with the human condition known as Gorham's disease are discussed. </text>

      <text>Sunitinib induces apoptosis in pheochromocytoma tumor cells by inhibiting VEGFR2/Akt/mTOR/S6K1 pathways through modulation of Bcl-2 and BAD.  Sunitinib is an oral multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic and antitumor activity that mainly targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs). Very recently, sunitinib has been shown to be an active agent for the treatment of malignant pheochromocytomas. However, it is unclear whether sunitinib acts only through an antiangiogenic mechanism or whether it may also directly target tumor cells. Sunitinib markedly induced apoptosis of PC12 cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, in support of these findings, we found that sunitinib induced a reduction in the expression of the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-2 as well as dephosphorylation of the proapoptotic molecule BAD, which results in the activation of BAD in these cells. Consistent with these apoptotic effects, our results showed that sunitinib inhibited phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR and was followed by a reduction of S6K1, which is a well-known target of mTOR. Knockdown of VEGFR-2 attenuated the sunitinib-induced effects, including apoptosis and inhibition of signaling pathways such as the phosphorylation of Akt as well as mTOR, and Bcl-2, which confirmed that these effects could be mediated by VEGFR-2. In addition, silencing of S6K1 induced apoptosis accompanied by a decrease in the phosphorylation of BAD and Bcl-2, similar to that observed with sunitinib treatment. Thus, these results together suggest that sunitinib initially exerts its apoptotic effect through the inhibition of VEGFR-2, which, when followed by reduction of its downstream effectors, including Akt/mTOR/S6K1, may lead to inhibition of the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-2 and activation of the proapoptotic molecule BAD in PC12 cells. However, PC12 cells do not precisely reflect the pathogenesis of malignant cells. Therefore, we confirmed the key findings by replicating these experiments in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. </text>

      <text>Development of a mouse model for lymph node metastasis with endometrial cancer.  Controlling lymph node metastasis is currently a key issue in cancer therapy. Lymph node metastasis is one of the most important prognostic factors in various types of cancers, including endometrial cancer. Vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) plays a crucial role in lymphangiogenesis, and is implicated to play an important role in lymph node metastasis. To evaluate the role of VEGF-C in lymph node metastasis, we developed an animal model by using an endometrial cancer cell line, HEC1A. This cell line is not invasive by nature and secretes moderate amounts of VEGF-C; intrauterine injection of HEC1A cells into Balb/c nude mice resulted in uterine cancer with lymph node metastasis after 8 weeks. To analyze the contribution of VEGF-C to lymph node metastasis, its corresponding gene was stably introduced into HEC1A cells (HEC1A/VEGF-C), which then produced more than 10 times the amount of VEGF-C. The number of lymph node metastases was significantly higher in HEC1A/VEGF-C cells than in HEC1A cells (3.2 vs 1.1 nodes/animal, respectively). Augmented lymphangiogenesis was observed within tumors when HEC1A/VEGF-C cells were inoculated. These results indicate that VEGF-C plays a critical role in lymph node metastasis, in addition to serving as a platform to test the efficacy of various therapeutic modalities against lymph node metastasis. </text>

      <text>[Rubella in Poland in 2009]. In Poland, 7,587 cases of rubella were registered in 2009 (incidence 19.9 per 100,000 population). According to a new rubella case definition, introduced in 2009, 7 (0.1%) cases were classified as confirmed cases, 30 (0.4%) as probable. One case of congenital rubella syndrome was reported. The incidence in men (26.6) was 1.9-times higher than in women (13.6). The highest incidence was observed in children aged 7 and 8 years (180.3 and 175.6, respectively). No rubella deaths were registered. An improvement of laboratory diagnosis of reported cases is necessary to assess the impact of 2-dose immunization implemented in 2003 on rubella epidemiology in Poland. </text>

      <text>Burns from hot wheat bags: a public safety issue. Introduction: Wheat bags are therapeutic devices that are heated in microwaves and commonly used to provide relief from muscle and joint pain. The Royal Adelaide Hospital Burns Unit has observed a number of patients with significant burn injuries resulting from their use. Despite their dangers, the products come with limited safety information. Methods: Data were collected from the Burns Unit database for all patients admitted with burns due to hot wheat bags from 2004 to 2009. This was analyzed to determine the severity of the burn injury and identify any predisposing factors. An experimental study was performed to measure the temperature of wheat bags when heated to determine their potential for causing thermal injury. Results: 11 patients were admitted with burns due to hot wheat bags. The median age was 52 years and the mean total body surface area was 1.1%. All burns were either deep dermal (45.5%) or full thickness (54.5%). Ten patients required operative management. Predisposing factors (eg, neuropathy) to thermal injury were identified in 7 patients. The experimental study showed that hot wheat bags reached temperatures of 57.3degreesC (135.1degreesF) when heated according to instructions, 63.3degreesC (145.9degreesF) in a 1000 W microwave and 69.6degreesC (157.3degreesF) on reheating. Conclusions: Hot wheat bags cause serious burn injury. When heated improperly, they can reach temperatures high enough to cause epidermal necrosis in a short period of time. Patients with impaired temperature sensation are particularly at risk. There should be greater public awareness of the dangers of wheat bag use and more specific safety warnings on the products. </text>

      <text>IL-17F deficiency inhibits small intestinal tumorigenesis in ApcMin/+ mice.  IL-17 plays an important role in gut homeostasis. However, the role of IL-17F in intestinal tumorigenesis has not been addressed. Here we demonstrate that ablation of IL-17F significantly inhibits spontaneous intestinal tumorigenesis in the small intestine of Apc(Min/+) mice. IL-17F ablation decreased IL-1beta and Cox-2 expression as well as IL-17 receptor C (IL-17RC) expression, which were increased in tumors from Apc(Min/+) mice. Lack of IL-17F did not reverse the splenomegaly but partially restored thymic atrophy, suggesting a local effect of IL-17F in the intestine. IL-17F deficient Apc(Min/+) mice showed a significant decrease in immune cell infiltration in the lamina propria. Interestingly, the expression of IL-17A from CD4 T cells in the lamina propria remains unchanged in the absence of IL-17F. Collectively, our results suggest the proinflammatory and essential role of IL-17F to develop spontaneous intestinal tumorigenesis in Apc(Min/+) mice in the presence of IL-17A. </text>

      <text>Curcumin inhibits metastatic progression of breast cancer cell through suppression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator by NF-kappa B signaling pathways.  Curcumin (1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione), is extracted from the plant Curcuma longa. It was recently reported for its anticancer effect on several types of cancer cells in vitro however, the molecular mechanisms of this anticancer effect are not fully understood. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of curcumin on human mammary epithelial carcinoma MCF-7 cells. Cells were treated with curcumin and examined for cell viability by MTT assay. The cells invasion was demonstrated by transwell assay. The binding activity of NF-kappaB to DNA was examined in nuclear extracts using Trans-AM NF-kappaB ELISA kit. Western blot was performed to detect the effect of curcumin on the expression of uPA. Our results showed that curcumin dose-dependently inhibited (P &lt; 0.05) the proliferation of MCF-7 cells. Meanwhile, the adhesion and invasion ability of MCF-7 cells were sharply inhibited when treated with different concentrations of curcumin. Curcumin also significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.05) the expression of uPA and NF-kappaB DNA binding activity, respectively. It is concluded that curcumin inhibits the adhesion and invasion of MCF-7 cells through down-regulating the protein expression of uPA via of NF-kappaB activation. Accordingly, the therapeutic potential of curcumin for breast cancer deserves further study. </text>

      <text>c-MYC functions as a molecular switch to alter the response of human mammary epithelial cells to oncostatin M.  Cytokines play an important role in creating an inflammatory microenvironment, which is now considered a hallmark of cancer. Although tumor cells can exploit cytokine signaling to promote growth, invasion, and metastasis, the response of normal and premalignant epithelial cells to cytokines present in a developing tumor microenvironment remains unclear. Oncostatin M (OSM), an IL-6 family cytokine responsible for STAT3 activation, has been implicated in cancer development, progression, invasion, and metastasis. Paradoxically, OSM can also suppress the growth of normal cells and certain tumor-derived cell lines. Using isogenic human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) at different stages of neoplastic transformation, we found that OSM signaling suppressed c-MYC expression and engaged a p16- and p53-independent growth arrest that required STAT3 activity. Inhibition of STAT3 activation by expressing a dominant-negative STAT3 protein or a STAT3-shRNA prevented the OSM-mediated arrest. In addition, expression of c-MYC from a constitutive promoter also abrogated the STAT3-mediated arrest, and strikingly, cooperated with OSM to promote anchorage-independent growth (AIG), a property associated with malignant transformation. Cooperative transformation by c-MYC and OSM required PI3K and AKT signaling, showing the importance of multiple signaling pathways downstream of the OSM receptor in defining the cellular response to cytokines. These findings identify c-MYC as an important molecular switch that alters the cellular response to OSM-mediated signaling from tumor suppressive to tumor promoting. </text>

      <text>PTHrP drives breast tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis in mice and is a potential therapy target.  Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) is a secreted factor expressed in almost all normal fetal and adult tissues. It is involved in a wide range of developmental and physiological processes, including serum calcium regulation. PTHrP is also associated with the progression of skeletal metastases, and its dysregulated expression in advanced cancers causes malignancy-associated hypercalcemia. Although PTHrP is frequently expressed by breast tumors and other solid cancers, its effects on tumor progression are unclear. Here, we demonstrate in mice pleiotropic involvement of PTHrP in key steps of breast cancer - it influences the initiation and progression of primary tumors and metastases. Pthrp ablation in the mammary epithelium of the PyMT-MMTV breast cancer mouse model caused a delay in primary tumor initiation, inhibited tumor progression, and reduced metastasis to distal sites. Mechanistically, it reduced expression of molecular markers of cell proliferation (Ki67) and angiogenesis (factor VIII), antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2, cell-cycle progression regulator cyclin D1, and survival factor AKT1. PTHrP also influenced expression of the adhesion factor CXCR4, and coexpression of PTHrP and CXCR4 was crucial for metastatic spread. Importantly, PTHrP-specific neutralizing antibodies slowed the progression and metastasis of human breast cancer xenografts. Our data identify what we believe to be new functions for PTHrP in several key steps of breast cancer and suggest that PTHrP may constitute a novel target for therapeutic intervention. </text>

      <text>Aquaporins in human breast cancer: identification and involvement in carcinogenesis of breast cancer.  BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Aquaporins (AQPs) play important roles in water and glycerol transport. Recently, the role of AQPs in human carcinogenesis has become an area of great interest. However, little is known about the function of AQPs in human breast cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression profile of AQPs in human breast cancer and its significance. METHODS: In this study, we screened the expression profile of AQP0-12 in breast cancer tissues and corresponding normal tissues by RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: AQP1, 3-5, and 10-12 were expressed in human breast cancer and/or normal breast tissues, and AQP1 and 3-5 exhibited differential expression. AQP1 was expressed in cell membranes and its expression was higher in cancer than that in normal tissues. AQP4 was expressed in the cell membrane and cytoplasm and was detected markedly stronger in normal than in cancer tissues. AQP5 was expressed mainly in cell membranes in carcinoma tissues, but was almost absent in normal breast tissues. Expression of AQP5 was associated with cellular differentiation, lymph node invasion, and clinicopathological staging. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggested that several subtypes of the AQP family play a role in human breast carcinogenesis. </text>

      <text>Research and discovery of the first human cancer virus, HTLV-1.  Human T-cell lymphoma virus (HTLV)-1 was the first human retrovirus to be discovered. It has been recognized as the cause of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). In addition to giving a historical perspective on HTLV-1 and other retrovirus research, this paper discusses the origin of HTLV-1; the modes of transmission and global epidemiology of HTLV-1 infection; the genome of HTLV-1 and the mechanism of HTLV-1-induced leukemogenesis; the role of HTLV-1 in other diseases, and recent breakthroughs in ATL therapy. </text>

      <text>Selective inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB by nuclear factor-kappaB essential modulator-binding domain peptide suppresses the metastasis of highly metastatic oral squamous cell carcinoma.  Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation contributes to the development of metastasis, thus leading to a poor prognosis in many cancers, including OSCC. However, little in vivo experimental data are available about the effects of NF-kappaB inhibition on OSCC metastasis. OSCC sublines were established from a GFP-expressing parental cell line, GSAS, and designated GSAS/N3 and N5 according to the in vivo passage number after cervical lymph node metastasis by a serial orthotopic transplantation model. In vitro migration and invasion were assessed in these cells, and the NF-kappaB activities and expression of NF-kappaB-regulated metastasis-related molecules were also examined. In in vivo experiments, the metastasis and survival of tumor-engrafted mice were monitored. Furthermore, the effects of a selective NF-kappaB inhibitor, NEMO-binding domain (NBD) peptide, on metastasis in GSAS/N5-engrafted mice were assessed, and engrafted tongue tumors were immunohistochemically examined. Highly metastatic GSAS/N3 and N5 cells showed an enhanced NF-kappaB activity, thus contributing to increased migration, invasion, and a poor prognosis compared with the parent cells. Furthermore, the expression levels of NF-kappaB-regulated metastasis-related molecules, such as fibronectin, beta1 integrin, MMP-1, -2, -9, and -14, and VEGF-C, were upregulated in the highly metastatic cells. The NBD peptide suppressed metastasis and tongue tumor growth in GSAS/N5-inoculated mice, and was accompanied by the downregulation of the NF-kappaB-regulated metastasis-related molecules in engrafted tongue tumors. Our results suggest that the selective inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by NBD peptide may provide an effective approach for the treatment of highly metastatic OSCC. </text>

      <text>beta-catenin signaling controls metastasis in Braf-activated Pten-deficient melanomas.  Malignant melanoma is characterized by frequent metastasis, however, specific changes that regulate this process have not been clearly delineated. Although it is well known that Wnt signaling is frequently dysregulated in melanoma, the functional implications of this observation are unclear. By modulating beta-catenin levels in a mouse model of melanoma that is based on melanocyte-specific Pten loss and Braf(V600E) mutation, we demonstrate that beta-catenin is a central mediator of melanoma metastasis to the lymph nodes and lungs. In addition to altering metastasis, beta-catenin levels control tumor differentiation and regulate both MAPK/Erk and PI3K/Akt signaling. Highly metastatic tumors with beta-catenin stabilization are very similar to a subset of human melanomas. Together these findings establish Wnt signaling as a metastasis regulator in melanoma. </text>

      <text>Mitochondrial apoptosis and FAK signaling disruption by a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor, HTPB, in antitumor and antimetastatic mouse models.  BACKGROUND: Compound targeting histone deacetylase (HDAC) represents a new era in molecular cancer therapeutics. However, effective HDAC inhibitors for the treatment of solid tumors remain to be developed. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we propose a novel HDAC inhibitor, N-Hydroxy-4-(4-phenylbutyryl-amino) benzamide (HTPB), as a potential chemotherapeutic drug for solid tumors. The HDAC inhibition of HTPB was confirmed using HDAC activity assay. The antiproliferative and anti-migratory mechanisms of HTPB were investigated by cell proliferation, flow cytometry, DNA ladder, caspase activity, Rho activity, F-actin polymerization, and gelatin-zymography for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Mice with tumor xenograft and experimental metastasis model were used to evaluate effects on tumor growth and metastasis. Our results indicated that HTPB was a pan-HDAC inhibitor in suppressing cell viability specifically of lung cancer cells but not of the normal lung cells. Upon HTPB treatment, cell cycle arrest was induced and subsequently led to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. HTPB disrupted F-actin dynamics via downregulating RhoA activity. Moreover, HTPB inhibited activity of MMP2 and MMP9, reduced integrin-beta1/focal adhesion complex formation and decreased pericellular poly-fibronectin assemblies. Finally, intraperitoneal injection or oral administration of HTPB efficiently inhibited A549 xenograft tumor growth in vivo without side effects. HTPB delayed lung metastasis of 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells. Acetylation of histone and non-histone proteins, induction of apoptotic-related proteins and de-phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase were confirmed in treated mice. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggested that intrinsic apoptotic pathway may involve in anti-tumor growth effects of HTPB in lung cancer cells. HTPB significantly suppresses tumor metastasis partly through inhibition of integrin-beta1/FAK/MMP/RhoA/F-actin pathways. We have provided convincing preclinical evidence that HTPB is a potent HDAC targeted inhibitor and is thus a promising candidate for lung cancer chemotherapy. </text>

      <text>Expression of HER2 and bradykinin B1 receptors in precursor lesions of gallbladder carcinoma.  AIM: To determine the expression of HER2 and bradykinin B(1) receptors (B(1)R) in the two pathogenic models of gallbladder cancer: the metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma and the adenoma-carcinoma pathways. METHODS: Receptor proteins were visualized by immunohistochemistry on 5-mum sections of paraffin-embedded tissue. Expression of both receptors was studied in biopsy samples from 92 patients (6 males and 86 females; age ranging from 28 to 86 years, mean 56 years). High HER2 expression in specimens was additionally investigated by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Cell proliferation in each sample was assessed by using the Ki-67 proliferation marker. RESULTS: HER2 receptor protein was absent in adenomas and in normal gallbladder epithelium. On the contrary, there was intense staining for HER2 on the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells of intestinal metaplasia (22/24; 91.7%) and carcinoma in situ (9/10; 90%), the lesions that displayed a significantly high proliferation index. Protein up-regulation of HER2 in the epithelium with metaplasia or carcinoma in situ was not accompanied by HER2 gene amplification. A similar result was observed in invasive carcinomas (0/12). The B(1)R distribution pattern mirrored that of HER2 except that B(1)R was additionally observed in the adenomas. The B(1)R appeared either as cytoplasmic dots or labeling on the apical cell membrane of the cells composing the epithelia with intestinal metaplasia (24/24; 100%) and carcinoma in situ (10/10; 100%) and in the epithelial cells of adenomas. In contrast, both HER2 (4/12; 33%) and B(1)R (1/12; 8.3%) showed a low expression in invasive gallbladder carcinomas. CONCLUSION: The up-regulation of HER2 and B(1)R in precursor lesions of gallbladder carcinoma suggests cross-talk between these two receptors that may be of importance in the modulation of cell proliferation in gallbladder carcinogenesis. </text>

      <text>Expression of basic fibroblast growth factor in normal human tissues. The distribution of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was studied immunohistochemically in fresh frozen sections of normal human tissues. Immunodetection was performed with a specific anti-bFGF mouse monoclonal antibody that was found to react with recombinant human bFGF in Western blot analysis, and to specifically neutralize the mitogenic activity of bFGF on bovine vascular endothelial cells. Expression of bFGF on normal human tissues was ubiquitously detected in the basement membranes of all size blood vessels, but was not found in epidermal or epithelial basement membranes of a variety of tissues tested. Intensity and patterns of localization in blood vessels was consistent in various tissues, but varied among different regions of the vascular bed. Whereas homogeneous and intense immunoreactivity were observed in large and intermediate size blood vessels, heterogeneity of expression was found in capillaries. The most intense immunoreactivity was observed in branching capillaries. Endothelial cell staining was heterogeneous and varied in different regions. Strong staining for bFGF was also found in cardiac muscle fibers, smooth muscle cells of mid-size blood vessels, the gut and the myometrium, in central nervous system neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells, and on epithelial cells of the bronchi, colon, endometrium, and sweat gland ducts of the skin. The presence of bFGF in the extracellular compartment of a diverse variety of organs may play a role in angiogenesis. However, the function of bFGF in parenchymal cells remains to be determined. </text>

      <text>Overexpression confers an oncogenic potential upon the eph gene.  The eph gene encodes a putative receptor tyrosine kinase for an as yet unknown ligand. Some human cancer cells have been found to overexpress eph mRNAs without gene amplification. We show here that NIH3T3 cells acquire tumorigenic ability in nude mice and make colonies in soft agar with a viral LTR (Long Terminal Repeat)-driven artificial expression of the eph gene to a high level. This result supports the alleged contribution of overexpressed receptor tyrosine kinases to cell transformation. </text>

      <text>The enlarging clinical spectrum of Lyme disease: Lyme cerebral vasculitis, a new disease entity. The case of a patient with cerebral vasculitis with a right thalamic infarct associated with cerebral spinal fluid Lyme disease is presented. This entity has not been described in the United States, and only one similar case in the world literature could be found. The patient presented with a progressive headache and subsequent development of grand mal seizure activity. Lyme disease has been associated with cranial nerve palsies, peripheral and cranial radiculopathies, aseptic meningitis, encephalitic symptoms, chorea, and demyelinating polyneuropathy presenting like Guillain-Barre syndrome. These syndromes can occur separately or in combination. Stroke and strokelike syndromes have been attributed to Lyme disease. The literature concerning the neurologic manifestations of Lyme disease is reviewed. </text>

      <text>Retinal revascularisation in diabetic retinopathy. The case history of a 33-year-old diabetic patient who has had diabetes for 24 years is presented. When first seen in 1975 he had bilateral proliferative retinopathy with new vessels in the retinal periphery. He had large areas of capillary non-perfusion lateral to the macula in the right eye associated with the new vessels. Nine years later, after extensive repeated photocoagulation, revascularisation of large areas previously not perfused were seen. The vessels are in the plane of the retina and do not have the appearance of new vessels. </text>

      <text>Gastric microcirculatory change and development of acute gastric mucosal lesions (stress ulcer). Concerning the pathogenesis of acute gastric mucosal lesions, gastric microcirculatory change has drawn attention as an important factor. In view of this fact, gastric mucosal blood flow and microvascular structure were investigated in normal and in burn stressed rats. Moreover, alterations in acid and pepsin activities in by morphological and biochemical procedures in order to evaluate the relationship between defensive and aggressive factors of the gastric mucosa. Gastric mucosal blood flow decreased significantly in early period after induction of stress (p less than 0.01). The incidence of ulceration showed a correlative relation with the decrease of mucosal blood flow. Reduction of blood flow in burn was due to opening of arteriovenular shunt and it appeared that this was responsible for mucosal ischemia and congestion. Following the decrease of blood flow, acid output was lower in stress than that in control. Finally, the results of these studies demonstrated the importance of defensive factors. The reduction of mucosal blood flow resulted in the sequence of events that led to formation of acute gastric mucosal lesion. </text>

      <text>Type-A cholecystokinin receptors in CHP212 neuroblastoma cells: evidence for association with G protein and activation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis. 125I-Bolton Hunter-cholecystokinin octapeptide (BH-CCK8) and (-)-[3H]L-364718 membrane binding assays were used to identify and characterize cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors in CHP212 human neuroblastoma cells. The ligand binding properties of CCK receptors in these cells are similar to those found in pancreas (CCK-A sites) and differ from the predominant type of CCK binding site found in brain (CCK-B sites). The specific binding of 125I-BH-CCK8 but not (-)-[3H]L-364718 was reduced by the metabolically stable GTP analog guanosine 5'-(beta-delta-imido)trisphosphate. A substantial difference in the Bmax for the radiolabeled agonist (125I-BH-CCK8) and antagonist [(-)-[3H]L-364718] was noted. These observations are consistent with CCK receptors existing in guanine nucleotide-binding protein-coupled and -uncoupled states. Similar to its action in pancreatic acinar cells, CCK8(S) stimulated the accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates in cells prelabeled with [3H]myo-inositol (EC50 = 3.2 +/- 0.4 nM; maximum response = 4.5 +/- 0.4 x basal). The intrinsic activity of CCK analogues in stimulating phosphoinositide hydrolysis was substantially less than their reported intrinsic activity in stimulating phosphoinositide hydrolysis in pancreatic acinar cells. The CHP212 neuroblastoma cell may serve as a useful model for the recently reported CCK-A binding site found in the central nervous system. </text>

      <text>Energy supply of the mitotic cell cycle and the Na+/H+-antiport in ascites tumors. The activation of Na+ transport is due to the exchange of protons formed via glucose conversion into lactate for Na+, i.e., to the stimulation of the Na+/H+-antiport. Experimental results and theoretical calculations suggest that in glucose-containing medium the Na+ transport increases from 0.75 to 1.78 pmol/hour per cell. The permeability of plasma membranes for K+ increases 2.75 fold, while the passive flux of Na+ diminishes. The intensity of O2 adsorption by ascites tumor cells does not practically depend on the monovalent cation concentration gradient between the cells and the culture medium, whereas the rate of glycolysis decreases simultaneously with the diminution of the concentration gradient. In synchronized cultures at the beginning of the mitotic cycle, the bulk of ATP resynthesized via glycolysis is utilized for the synthesis of biopolymers, whereas that at the end of the S-phase and in the G2-phase is utilized for cation transport across plasma membranes. From 35 to 100% of the whole amount of ATP resynthesized via glycolysis is utilized for transport purposes. It is concluded that the observed increase in the Na+/K+ ratio in ascites tumor cells is connected with their enhanced ability to synthesize lactic acid. Presumably, glycolysis is one of the regulatory mechanisms of intracellular ratios of monovalent cations. </text>

      <text>Screening method for insecticidal activity using first instars of black blow fly (Diptera: Calliphoridae). A bioassay method suitable for rapid mass screening of fermentation and synthetic organic compounds for insecticidal activity is described. The test, which uses first instars of susceptible black blow fly, Phormia regina (Meigen), in a bovine serum medium, detects insecticidal activity with reproducible results. It is capable of selecting the most active compound in structure-activity relationships by minimum effective dose concentration studies. The bioassay system is easy to operate and requires only a minute quantity of chemical compound. </text>

      <text>Early post-mortem metabolism and muscle shortening in the Pectoralis major muscle of broiler chickens. Three experiments were conducted to examine the effects of sodium pentobarbital (SP), iodoacetate (IO), tubocurarine (TC), and surgical denervation (DN) on early rigor development in broiler breast muscle. In Experiment 1, birds were either anesthetized or not with SP before receiving an injection of IO or TC or maintained as noninjected controls. Experiment 2 was identical except that a treatment of denervation of the breast muscle was added. Experiment 3 was conducted to contrast birds at 1 day (DN1) and 3 days (DN3) denervation prior to slaughter to nonoperated controls. Measurements of muscle lactate, ATP, R value (ratio of inosine to adenine nucleotides), pH, sarcomere lengths, and shear were used to evaluate treatment effects. Results for Experiment 1 showed no significant differences among treatment and control groups for ATP and lactate contents, R values, or sarcomere lengths; however, significantly lower pH and higher shear values were observed for control birds. In Experiment 2, no significant differences were observed among the treatment groups for ATP, R values, or sarcomere lengths. However, lactate and shear values were significantly lower, and pH higher, for the DN and SP treated birds. Experiment 3 resulted in lower lactate and higher pH values for the DN3 treatment in comparison with both DN1 and control groups. Results of these studies indicate that the use of SP and DN can be used to alter the early profiles of rigor development. </text>

      <text>[Tumor metastasis and the fibrinolytic system].  Metastatic spread of malignant tumor appears to correlate with activation of the fibrolytic system. The role of fibrinolysis in growth and metastasis was examined in Lewis lung carcinoma of mice. The inhibition of fibrinolysis or proteases decreased the primary tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis, whereas the activation of fibrinolysis or proteases increased the number of metastatic foci in the lung. Electronmicroscopically, thrombus formation in the primary site prevented tumor invasion and metastasis formation. Plasminogen activator (PA) content of excised tumors was determined by SDS-PAGE, and major PA was found to be urokinase (UK) type. Immunohistochemical study with specific antisera was done. When tumor cells possessed a high level of UK, laminin and type IV collagen, components of the basement membrane, disappeared from tumor tissues. These findings suggest that PA through protease cascade plays a role in tumor invasion and metastasis. Clinically, patients with advanced cancer are usually in a hypercoagulable state with elevated fibrinogen, and fibrin deposition around tumor mass is a serious problem in cancer chemotherapy. UK infusion prior to 5-fluorouracil increased tissue concentration of antitumor agent. However, development of consumption coagulopathy characterized by progression from hypercoagulable state to disseminated intravascular coagulation has also been found in several cases. </text>

      <text>Invagination of the otic placode: normal development and experimental manipulation. The inner ear forms from paired ectodermal primordia that lie to either side of the developing hindbrain. Initially each primordium forms a shallow depression in the ectodermal surface. Invagination to form an otic pit coincides with the formation of several deep folds in the epithelial surface. An initial fold appears parallel to the embryonic axis and at the junction of the rhombencephalon with somitomeric mesoderm. This is followed by formation of cranial and caudal folds perpendicular to the axis and minor folds that are within the pit formed by earlier folding. The central region of the otic primordium remains in close apposition to the lateral surface of the neural tube during the process of fold formation, until the otic pit becomes quite deep. At that time, mesenchymal cells penetrate between the two layers. Experimental analysis of invagination supports the conclusion that otic invagination is controlled differently from that of similar organ primordia, such as the eye and thyroid. Whereas these other primordia can be stimulated to undergo normal morphogenetic shape changes precociously by treatments that presumably activate motile processes in the cytoskeleton, the same conditions have little effect on the otic placode. Similarly, neither inhibitors of calcium transport nor inactivators of calmodulin activity prevent otic pit formation, while these drugs block invagination of other primordia. These results suggest that otic invagination may be caused by changes in the surrounding tissues rather than by an activation of motility within the primordium. </text>

      <text>Anaplastic and sarcomatoid carcinoma of the small intestine: a clinicopathologic study. Carcinomas involving the jejunum and ileum are rare tumors. During a review of small intestinal neoplasms, six primary carcinomas of jejunum or ileum with an anaplastic and sarcomatoid histology were identified. At presentation, three of the patients had symptoms related to metastatic disease and three had symptoms referable to the local tumor. The tumors were large (greater than 4.5 cm in diameter), usually endophytic masses composed of large cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, anaplastic nuclei, and prominent nucleoli. In many areas, the cells had a spindled configuration. Mucin positivity was identified in all six cases. Electron microscopic findings in two cases were indicative of epithelial differentiation. The tumors behaved aggressively; all five patients for whom there was clinical follow-up died of metastases within 40 months. The six anaplastic and sarcomatoid carcinomas were compared with 29 typical adenocarcinomas arising in the jejunum or ileum. Only two of the latter group had symptoms referable to distant metastases at presentation. These tumors also tended to be smaller at presentation (11 tumors were less than 4 cm in greatest dimension). Of 25 patients with typical adenocarcinomas who had acceptable follow-up, 18 (72%) died of disease and five (20%) were alive with no evidence of disease after 5 years. We conclude that anaplastic and sarcomatoid carcinoma is a rare variant of small intestinal carcinoma with an aggressive clinical course. </text>

      <text>Time course of transmitter action at the sympathetic neuroeffector junction in rodent vascular and non-vascular smooth muscle. 1. Transmitter release from sympathetic postganglionic nerve terminals innervating the guinea-pig and mouse vas deferens and the rat tail artery has been studied in vitro by focal extracellular recording with particular emphasis on the time course of transmitter action underlying the intracellular potential changes. 2. In the absence of stimulation, spontaneous excitatory junction currents (SEJCs) were recorded with amplitudes up to 500 microV and durations between 40 and 100 ms. SEJCs were unaffected by the competitive alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin but blocked by alpha, beta-methylene ATP which desensitizes P2-purinoceptors. 3. During trains of supramaximal stimuli at 0.1-4 Hz stimulus locked excitatory junction currents (EJCs) were evoked intermittently from the population of varicosities located under the suction electrode. 4. SEJCs were similar in amplitude and time course to EJCs evoked by low-frequency stimulation in the same attachment in all three tissues. 5. SEJCs recorded using either a conventional AC amplifier or a patch clamp amplifier had the same time course. 6. These studies show that the time course of the current underlying the excitatory junction potential is brief and essentially the same in three different tissues. The prolonged time course of the excitatory junction potential in different tissues can be accounted for by the passive membrane properties. </text>

      <text>On the mechanism of glycolysis stimulation by neutral detergents in 3T3 and Ehrlich ascites tumor cells.  Glycolysis of 3T3 and Ehrlich ascites tumor cells was greatly enhanced by Nonidet P-40 or Triton X-100 at about 100 micrograms/mg cell protein. This enhanced glycolysis was partly sensitive to rutamycin and partly sensitive to ouabain, suggesting that the detergent released the control of the ATPase of the mitochondria and of the plasma membrane Na+K+-ATPase. Nonidet P-40 had no effect on glycolysis in cell-free extracts from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells to which soluble mitochondrial ATPase was added. Measuring ouabain-sensitive 22Na efflux and using ouabain-sensitive lactate production as a measure of ATP hydrolysis by the Na+K+ pump, it was shown that Nonidet P-40 greatly decreased the efficiency of the Na+K+ pump. Quercetin increased the efficiency of pumping in EAT cells both in the absence and presence of the detergent. </text>

      <text>Elevated levels of diacylglycerol and decreased phorbol ester sensitivity in ras-transformed fibroblasts.  Diacylglycerol (DG) plays a central role in phospholipid metabolism and is an endogenous activator of protein kinase C. We have suggested that constitutive activation of this kinase is one mechanism by which oncogenes transform cells. The ras-encoded proteins are similar to regulatory G-proteins and are candidates for the unknown G-protein that modulates phosphatidylinositol (PI) turnover. Differences in polyphosphoinositide metabolism have been reported for ras-transformed cells. But because these experiments were performed on confluent cultures of established cell lines, the differences are difficult to attribute to ras transformation. Here we show that exponentially growing NIH 3T3 fibroblasts recently transformed by Ha-ras or Ki-ras possess elevated DG concentrations without significant alterations in the levels of other polyphosphoinositide metabolites. The basal phosphorylation of protein kinase C substrate of relative molecular mass (Mr) 80,000 (80K) is significantly increased in all the ras-transformed cell lines. Surprisingly, however, further phosphorylation of this protein on addition of phorbol ester was greatly reduced. Ha-ras cells also show less binding of phorbol ester than control cells, suggesting that elevation of DG causes partial down-regulation in addition to activation of protein kinase C. </text>

      <text>Epidermal growth factor and its receptor.  Epidermal growth factor (EGF) binds with high affinity and specificity to a single site on the external domain of its transmembrane receptor to activate the tyrosine protein kinase activity of its cytoplasmic portion. The EGF receptor gene is amplified and over-expressed in several human tumors, suggesting that increased concentrations of the proto-oncogene leads to constitutive activity similar to that seen with oncogene erb B. Synthesis and degradation of the EGF receptor are regulated, in addition, covalent modification by phosphorylation regulates activity of the receptor protein. Intramolecular self-phosphorylation of Tyr1173 removes a competitive inhibitory constraint to enhance phosphorylation of substrates. Phosphorylation of Thr654 by protein kinase C decreases high affinity EGF binding and EGF-stimulated tyrosine protein kinase activity, providing a mechanism for heterologous regulation of the EGF receptor by tumor promoters and other ligand X receptor complexes. Extensive regulation contributes to normal growth control, abrogation of regulatory controls contributes to uncontrolled growth as seen with erb B transformation and EGF receptor gene amplification in human tumors. </text>

      <text>Differential secretion of proteins and glycoproteins by livers of immature and adult rats. Effect of antimicrotubule drugs. This study was initiated to re-examine reported differences in the action of antimicrotubule agents on plasma protein secretion from livers of immature versus adult rats. The aim was (1) to determine the composition and to monitor the secretion of various plasma proteins and glycoproteins from liver slices labeled in vitro with specific amino acids and sugar residues, and (2) to correlate observed differences in secretion of these proteins with structural changes in the hepatocytes of the different aged animals. For the most part, slices of liver from fetal (term), neonatal (4- to 5 days old), and adult rats (70 days old) were incubated with radioactive amino acids or various tritiated sugars specific for N-linked core oligosaccharide and/or N-linked terminal oligosaccharide chains. Our findings indicate that liver slices of fetal and neonatal rats are efficient in synthesizing plasma proteins including fully glycosylated glycoproteins. The secretion of glycosylated and nonglycosylated proteins believed to be processed through Golgi complexes was inhibited to the same extent (approximately 70-80%) by antimicrotubule agents, regardless of the age of the host animal. However, other proteins and glycoproteins secreted by livers of immature rats were found to be relatively insensitive (i.e. inhibited to only 30-40%) to the action of various antimicrotubule drugs. The glycoproteins were found to lack N-linked terminal sugars (although the glycoproteins did contain N-linked core sugars), and it is likely that the drug-insensitive proteins bypassed critical glycosylating sites in the Golgi compartment prior to release. Overall, these findings support earlier data showing that antimicrotubule drugs have a special impact on Golgi-associated events in liver cells. To what extent these findings are related to the action of microtubules remains to be seen. </text>

      <text>The posterior tether in scoliosis. The hypothesis that a localized lordosis, or tethering of the posterior elements of the spine, is the primary cause of the vertebral rotation in idiopathic scoliosis was investigated in anatomic specimens of human and calf spinal columns. The specimens were axially loaded with and without a posterior tether created using Zielke instrumentation. Lateral deflection and axial rotation were monitored roentgenographically. The vertebrae of tethered spines showed increased rotation in the direction associated with idiopathic scoliosis. The spinous processes moved toward the concavity at the apex of the induced lateral curve. Conversely, untethered spines either exhibited little rotation or rotated in the opposite direction; the spinous processes moved toward the convexity of the curve. Rotations toward the convexity occur in rotational kyphosis. Thus the hypothesis that idiopathic scoliosis is a rotational lordosis is substantiated; the characteristic rotation can be explained with the aid of a geometric model. </text>

      <text>Glutamine and glucose as energy substrates for Ehrlich ascites tumour cells. Energy metabolism of freshly harvested Ehrlich ascites tumour cells in the presence of 5 mM glucose and/or 0.5 mM glutamine was studied. The rate of oxygen utilization was not altered by the addition of 0.5 mM glutamine; 5 mM glucose induced an inhibition of respiration. In the presence of both glucose and glutamine, the Crabtree effect decreased. In these conditions, the rates of oxygen uptake, the CO2 evolution and the changes in the redox states of cytochromes indicate that glucose is preferred by Ehrlich ascites tumour cells as energy substrate. Glucose decreased the rate of glutamine utilization by 34%. On the other hand, glutaminolysis did not inhibit glycolysis. </text>

      <text>Growth state-dependent regulation of protein kinase C in normal and transformed murine cells.  We determined whether growth state can influence the action of protein kinase C by measuring protein kinase C activity in growing and stationary cultures of normal and transformed cells. Two approaches were used to measure protein kinase C: assay of intact cells for inhibition of epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding in response to phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu); and assay of detergent extracts for total calcium, phospholipid-dependent kinase activity. In extracts of growing and stationary Swiss 3T3 cells, the total amount of protein kinase C activity was similar, indicating that growth state does not alter the level of enzyme in the cell. The short-term response of Swiss 3T3 cells to an activator of protein kinase C also appeared to be independent of growth state, since the 50% effective dose for PDBu inhibition of EGF binding to its receptor was approximately 7 nM for both growth conditions. In contrast, the response of cells to long-term treatment with PDBu was significantly different depending upon the initial growth state of the cells. In both growth states, PDBu caused loss of protein kinase C activity, which reflected a loss in protein mass as determined by immunoblotting with antiserum to protein kinase C. However, the maximum decrease approached 100% in stationary cultures versus approximately 75% in growing cells. Protein kinase C levels in several transformed cell lines were subject to down modulation in a similar growth state-dependent manner. Further, the inhibition of EGF binding by tumor promoters following long-term treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with PDBu also varied with growth state. In down modulated growing cells, PDBu caused almost complete inhibition of EGF binding, whereas in down modulated stationary cells, minimal inhibition of EGF binding by PDBu was observed. These results suggest that prolonged treatment with tumor promoters alters the sensitivity of cells to activators of protein kinase C in a growth state-dependent manner. </text>

      <text>Suppression and re-expression of transformed phenotype in hybrids of HA-ras-1-transformed rat-1 cells and early-passage rat embryonic fibroblasts.  Rat-1 cells which had been transformed with the activated Ha-ras-1 gene from human EJ bladder carcinoma cells were fused with diploid embryonic rat fibroblasts. Four selected cell hybrids expressed the human transforming gene product p21 at levels of 10 to 30% compared to 100% in the transformed parental cells. The hybrid cells, however, exhibited normal morphology, anchorage requirement for proliferation, and largely extended latency periods of tumorigenicity in newborn rats. Tumorigenic hybrid derivatives contained lower numbers of chromosomes than the tetraploid parental hybrids. DNA of the non-tumorigenic cell hybrids transformed Rat-1 cells to anchorage-independent proliferation as expected for the transforming human Ha-ras gene present in the donor DNA. We conclude that the transforming properties of the activated Ha-ras gene in Rat-1 cells can be suppressed at the post-translational level by the presence of the genome from diploid embryonic rat fibroblasts but additional controls of expression of the transforming gene are likely to exist. Normal cells contain suppressor gene(s) which safeguard these cells against transformation by the product of the transforming Ha-ras-1 oncogene. </text>

      <text>Torsade de pointes during loading with amiodarone. Torsade de pointes represents a potential complication of chronic amiodarone therapy. Several reports have emphasized the need for a loading dose in order to achieve therapeutic blood levels rapidly. We report a case of torsade de pointes following a single oral dose of amiodarone (1400 mg or 30 mg kg-1) administered after short intravenous loading for prevention of paroxysmal atrial flutter. Torsades de pointes were preceded and associated with marked QT prolongation and bradycardia. This report suggests that careful monitoring of patients undergoing oral amiodarone loading is necessary. </text>

      <text>Clinical evaluation of radiotherapy for Graves' ophthalmopathy. Seventeen patients with moderately severe ophthalmopathy due to Graves' disease were treated by cobalt or supervoltage radiotherapy. All patients complained of diplopia. The mean proptosis value was 21.4 mm. Three patients (18%) showed good response, 7 (41%) moderate and 7 minimal or no response. Improvement was noted mainly in soft tissue changes and diplopia, while proptosis decreased in only 5 patients. All except one patient who had marked extraocular muscle involvement revealed by computed tomography responded to treatment. These data indicate that radiotherapy may be indicated in patients with progressive ophthalmopathy, especially in those who are associated with extraocular muscle enlargement. </text>

      <text>The effect of aflatoxin B1 on the utilization of serum calcium. The mathematical analysis for plasma disappearance curve of aflatoxicosed animals, subsequently injected with 45Ca was determined. The analysis showed that the three main compartments of the calcium pool (plasma, bone and the labile calcium pool on the surface of bone and soft tissues) had been affected. Specifically, the fractional rate constant for migration of 45Ca from plasma pool to the labile pool had been diminished to its third value. This led to a corresponding reduction in the calcium content of the bone ash. The probable mechanism by which aflatoxin B1 affects calcium dynamics may be interpreted by the inhibitory effect of aflatoxin in the hydroxylation mechanism of vitamin D3 into an active intermediate. During aflatoxicosis (induction of 15 days) the animals entered a state of calcium deficiency, secondary to intestinal absorption inhibition. This was followed by bone resorption and disturbance of the fractional removal rate constant among different calcium compartments. </text>

      <text>Mast cells and tumors. The specific enhancement of tumor proliferation in vitro. Mast cells were found to be unique among the peritoneal leukocytes by virtue of their capacity to enhance profoundly the proliferation of a variety of tumors in vitro. This phenomenon occurs at mast cell/tumor ratios which reflect the stoichiometry of host cell/tumor relationships in vivo. The growth factor was found to reside in mast cell granules and was identified as heparin by sequential purification and enzymatic degradation. This cellular interaction was tumor-specific, although isolated granules could enhance fibroblast proliferation. The findings are discussed in relation to previous morphologic studies, reports of in vitro mast-cell-mediated tumor cytotoxicity, and the role of mast cells in angiogenesis and connective tissue proliferation. </text>

      <text>Management of the tortuous internal carotid artery. The tortuous internal carotid artery as the basis of cerebral vascular insufficiency is a controversial entity, as such lesions frequently occur without neurologic symptoms. However, some tortuous vessels are associated with significant carotid atherosclerotic disease requiring a specific surgical approach. This formed the basis of our report. Symptoms of cerebrovascular insufficiency in association with a tortuous internal carotid artery was encountered in 27 of 853 carotid endarterectomies over a 22 year period. Stenosis of hemodynamic significance was noted in nine patients and irregularities or ulceration were noted in the rest. With the standard technique of carotid endarterectomy, removal of plaque from a tortuous vessel leads to loss of the stenting effect provided by the plaque such that angulation occlusion is likely to occur. The optimal reconstruction in our experience is eversion endarterectomy by transection and lower reimplantation of the internal carotid artery on the common carotid artery. Our experience with 17 such procedures in 15 patients has been presented. </text>

      <text>Rapid enzyme analysis of amniotic fluid phospholipids containing choline: a comparison with the lecithin to sphingomyelin ratio in prenatal assessment of fetal lung maturity. The relation between the choline containing surfactant phospholipids lecithin and sphingomyelin in amniotic fluid and fetal lung maturity is well established. An enzymatic method that had been automated and optimised for use on a centrifugal analyser was used to measure the total choline containing phospholipids in amniotic fluid. The total time taken for this assay was 10 minutes. The results obtained from 100 patient samples, using this procedure, compared favourably with the results obtained by the thin layer chromatography procedure used to determine the lecithin to sphingomyelin ratio (r = 0.93). A clinical study of 60 patients showed that this assay predicted prenatal respiratory distress syndrome as well as the lecithin to sphingomyelin ratios. The advantage of this assay over existing procedures is that it requires minimum preparation of the specimen and no extraction, is quick, and shows a high degree of precision. </text>

      <text>Differences between the arterial and the venous pathomorphology in Buerger's disease. Morphological lesions were found to be different in arteries and in veins, in 9 cases of Buerger's disease. The arterial lesions were not characteristic and consisted of non-specific inflammation, thrombosis and obliteration which also occur in many other disease. In contrast, in addition to wall infiltration and thrombosis, the veins showed microabscesses and giant cell granulomas, which we believe to be absent in all other known diseases. The affected venous segment exhibited a variety of lesions. In the earliest period, the morphological aspect of inflammation in arteries and veins was fairly similar. In a late periods, that is those of vascular obliteration, the arteries and veins did not show any distinguishing morphological differences. </text>

      <text>Identification of the putative transforming protein of the human T-cell leukemia viruses HTLV-I and HTLV-II.  The human T-cell leukemia viruses HTLV-I and HTLV-II are unique among the transforming retroviruses of vertebrates in their ability to transform human T cells in vitro and in their close association with human malignancies (T-cell lymphomas and leukemia). Their genomes are relatively simple, containing the genes gag, pol, env, and a 3' region termed "X." This 3' region may be responsible for the transforming potential of the viruses. The existence of proteins encoded by the 3' region has been postulated on the basis of multiple open reading frames. In the present study this region is shown to contain a gene encoding a protein of 40 kilodaltons in HTLV-I and 37 kilodaltons in HTLV-II. It is proposed that these proteins be called, respectively, p40xI and p37xII. </text>

      <text>Phosphorylation-induced mobility shift in phospholamban in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Evidence for a protein structure consisting of multiple identical phosphorylatable subunits. Phosphorylation of purified phospholamban isolated from canine cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles decreased the electrophoretic mobility of the protein in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels. Different mobility forms of phospholamban in SDS gels were visualized both by direct protein staining and by autoradiography. Unphosphorylated phospholamban migrated with an apparent Mr = 25,000 in SDS gels; maximal phosphorylation of phospholamban by cAMP- or Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase increased the apparent Mr to 27,000. Partial phosphorylation of phospholamban by either protein kinase gave intermediate mobility forms of molecular weights between 25,000 and 27,000, suggesting that more than one phosphorylation site was present on the holoprotein for each activity. Boiling of phospholamban in SDS dissociated the holoprotein into an apparently homogeneous class of low molecular weight "monomers." Only two mobility forms of monomeric phospholamban were observed in SDS gels after phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, corresponding to 9-kDa dephospho- and 11-kDa phosphoproteins. All of the 9-kDa protein could be phosphorylated and converted into the 11-kDa mobility form, suggesting the presence of only one site of phosphorylation on a single type of monomer for cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Simultaneous phosphorylation of monomeric phospholamban by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase gave an additional mobility form of the protein, suggesting that different sites of phosphorylation were present for each activity on each monomer. Incomplete dissociation of the holoprotein by boiling it in a relatively low concentration of SDS facilitated the detection of five major mobility forms of the protein in SDS gels, and the mobilities of all of these forms were decreased by phosphorylation. We propose that the high molecular weight form of phospholamban is a multimer of electrophoretically indistinguishable monomers, each of which contains a different phosphorylation site for cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity and Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity. Phosphorylation of phospholamban at multiple sites is responsible for the various mobility forms of the holoprotein detected in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. </text>

      <text>Cells transformed by Rous sarcoma virus release transforming growth factors.  Chicken embryo fibroblasts and hamster BHK cells transformed by Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) release in their culture media growth factors which enhance markedly anchorage-independent colony formation in gelified medium, at the restrictive temperature (41 degrees 5 C), of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) infected by RSV mutants with a ts mutation of the src gene. This action is not observed with uninfected CEF, and, therefore, appears to require some expression of the viral src gene in the target cells. The enhancing factors are proteins related to the family of the transforming growth factors (TGFs) by their molecular weight (about 20 kd), their heat and acid resistance, and their sensitivity to dithiothreitol. They do not compete with 125I EGF for binding on the EGF receptors of the membrane of A431 cells. As chicken embryo fibroblasts are devoid of EGF receptors, their activity is not potentiated by EGF. </text>

      <text>The genetics of transformation by SV 40.  Experiments using the tsA 58 allele of the SV 40-A gene have demonstrated that the SV 40 large T-antigen is strictly required both for immortalization and induction anchorage independence of cells. It has been suggested that the immortalized phenotype is mediated by an extra cellular factor. The synthesis and/or the excretion of this factor in a medium is controlled by the A gene. </text>

      <text>Molecular events leading to enhanced glucose transport in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed cells.  Transformation by Rous sarcoma virus results in a dramatic increase in the rate at which the transformed cells transport glucose across the cell membrane. The increased transport rate is a consequence of an increased number of transporters in the transformed cells. Utilizing antibody raised against the purified human erythrocyte glucose transporter, we have identified the glucose transporter as a membrane glycoprotein with a monomer Mr of approximately 41,000. The increased rate of glucose transport is dependent on the activity of pp60src, the transforming protein of Rous sarcoma virus. This protein has been shown to be a protein kinase that phosphorylates on tyrosine residues. We have examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of a major cellular protein of Mr 36,000 in cells infected with a panel of partially transforming mutants of Rous sarcoma virus. One of these mutants (CU2) increases the rate of glucose transport only slightly and does not render the infected cells fully anchorage independent or tumorigenic (although other transformation parameters are fully induced). Cells infected with this mutant display a 36,000-dalton protein that is phosphorylated to a considerably lesser extent than cells infected with wild-type virus. Analyses of this sort may help to identify the cellular targets of pp60src whose phosphorylation is necessary for the increased glucose transport rate. </text>

      <text>Preliminary evidence for a pyridine nucleotide cycle in Bordetella pertussis. Preliminary evidence that Bordetella pertussis has a functional pyridine nucleotide cycle was the observation that [14C]-nicotinic acid was rapidly metabolized during its uptake by the bacteria to pyridine nucleotides and nicotinamide. Nicotinamide deamidase activity, necessary for the completion of the cycle by conversion of nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, was found in a soluble extract (20 000 X g supernatant) of B. pertussis cell lysates. </text>

      <text>Use of monoclonal antibodies to investigate a possible role of thyroglobulin in the pathogenesis of Graves' ophthalmopathy. One possible mechanism for Graves' ophthalmopathy is that the progressive orbital inflammation is initiated by formation of thyroglobulin (Tg)-anti-Tg immune complexes at sites of Tg binding to extraocular muscle membranes. In this study monoclonal antibodies (MCAB) against human Tg were used as probes (1) to identify Tg in eye muscle membranes prepared from normal subjects and (2) to measure binding of human Tg and Tg-anti-Tg immune complexes to eye muscle membranes. Reactivity of anti-Tg MCAB with Tg, thyroid, and eye muscle membranes was determined by binding of [125I]anti-Tg monoclonal antibody, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the indirect immunofluorescence technique. Seven membrane fractions, prepared by differential sucrose gradient centrifugation, were used. Whereas [125I]anti-Tg MCAB bound to all thyroid membrane fractions tested, no [125I]anti-Tg bound to eye muscle membranes. Similarly, reactivity of anti-Tg MCAB with eye muscle membranes was not demonstrated in ELISA or immunofluorescence tests. Although Tg-anti-Tg immune complexes bound to thyroid membranes, such complexes did not bind to eye muscle membranes. Significant binding of [125I]human Tg to eye muscle or thyroid membranes was not demonstrated for any membrane preparation. On the other hand moderate, but significant, binding to skeletal muscle was shown. Similar results were found using an ELISA. Binding of [125I]anti-Tg-Tg complexes of [125I]Tg to thyroid and eye muscle membranes was not affected by the presence of normal human serum, phosphate ions, pH, or incubation temperature, conditions claimed by others to be critical for Tg and Tg-anti-Tg immune complex binding. Since Tg is not present in normal human eye muscle a major role of Tg, or Tg-anti-Tg immune complexes, in the pathogenesis of Graves' ophthalmopathy appears to have been excluded by these findings. </text>

      <text>DNA methylation and expression of HLA-DR alpha.  B-cell lines established from two individuals with T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) express HLA-DR antigens, whereas the isogenic T-cells do not. The lack of expression correlates with a lack of detectable HLA-DR mRNA. All of the DR alpha DNA sequences detected by a cloned DR alpha cDNA probe are contained in a BglII fragment which varies slightly in size (4.0 to 4.8 kilobases) from one individual to another. In DNA from the T-cells not expressing DR alpha mRNA, all of the potential HpaII sites within the BglII fragment appeared to be methylated. In contrast, at least some of these sites were not methylated in DNA from the B-cells expressing high levels of DR alpha mRNA. Treatment of these T-cells with 5-azacytidine resulted in the induction of DR surface antigen expression, the appearance of DR alpha mRNA, and the partial demethylation of the DR alpha DNA sequences. T-cell lines established from human T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus associated T-cell neoplasias, in contrast to the T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia cell lines, expressed both DR antigens and DR alpha mRNA; the HpaII sites within the BglII fragment of DR alpha DNA of these human T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus-positive T-cell lines were in all cases at least partially unmethylated. Uncultured peripheral blood T-cells from human T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus-infected individuals expressed DR antigens at a low level, and the DR alpha locus was partially unmethylated. After 48 h in culture, DR antigen expression was substantially increased, but no significant changes were observed in methylation of the DR alpha locus or in the amount of DR mRNA which was present. This suggests that expression of DR antigens also can be modulated post-transcriptionally. </text>

      <text>Rapid micromeasurement of lactate in whole blood. A new lactate sensor makes it possible to measure the lactate content of whole blood directly in less than 1 min, using only a 10-microL blood sample. The procedure works equally well with plasma, serum, spinal fluid, other body fluids, or tissue homogenates. The instrument is calibrated with lactate standards between 0 and 15 mMol/L. The sensor, a polarographic enzyme electrode, gives a current which is a linear function of the lactate concentration. There is no interference from glucose, pyruvate, alcohol, ascorbate, anticoagulants, lidocaine, acetaminophen, or other drugs and metabolites commonly encountered in critically ill patients. The lactate sensor is composed of a peroxide sensor and an enzyme transducer membrane. The lactate is stoichiometrically converted to pyruvate and hydrogen peroxide by lactate oxygen oxidoreductase derived from Pediococcus species. The oxygen required for the enzymatic oxidation is supplied via an air-permeable silicone elastomeric membrane used for stirring. Comparison of our new electroenzymatic method with the Boehringer-Mannheim photoenzymatic method gives correlations of 0.997 for both whole blood and plasma. </text>

      <text>Hemostasis and mechanism of action of selective antimetastatic drugs in mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma.  The selective antimetastatic agents p-(3,3-dimethyl-1-triazeno)benzoic acid potassium salt (DM-COOK), 5-(3,3-dimethyl-1-triazeno)imidazole-4-carboxamide (DTIC) and (+/-)1,2-di(3,5-dioxopiperazin-1-yl)propane (ICRF-159) have been shown to markedly depress the formation of spontaneous hematogenous metastases in mice bearing s.c. Lewis lung carcinoma, with a mechanism unrelated to cytotoxicity for tumor cells. The effects on hemostasis of DM-COOK, DTIC and ICRF-159 have thus been examined in comparison with those of a purely cytotoxic agent, cyclophosphamide, in mice bearing i.m. Lewis lung carcinoma. The parameters considered are the number of platelets and their aggregability, prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times, plasma fibrinogen concentration and tumor cell procoagulant activity. Slight variations are caused by drug treatment in tumor-bearing mice as compared with untreated tumor-bearing controls; the pattern of effects of the selective antimetastatic agents does not differ from that of the reference cytotoxic compound used, cyclophosphamide. These data thus indicate that the effects on hemostasis of the drugs examined can contribute only marginally to their antimetastatic action, since more pronounced effects on hemostasis have been shown to be required to significantly affect metastasis formation. </text>

      <text>Purification and characterization of various esterases from rat liver. The major rat liver microsomal esterases acting on o-nitrophenylacetate with isoelectric points 5.0, 5.5, 6.1 and 6.4 were resolved by isoelectric focusing. Molecular weights were determined by sedimentation analysis in isokinetic gradients of sucrose and, after purification, in sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Their subunit molecular weights were between 57 000 and 60 000. They behaved as monomers except the pI-6.1 enzyme which behaved as a trimer. Esterases of pI 5.0, pI 6.1 and pI 6.4 behaved like glycoproteins of the polymannose type in the presence of 125I-labelled concanavalin A. Preparations of the pI-5.0 enzyme contained two esterases of highly homologous structure. Antibodies directed against this preparation did not inhibit but precipitated pI-5.0 esterase activity quantitatively. They did not react with the pI-6.1 and pI-6.4 esterases but precipitated several nonimmunologically related esterases. Two of these enzymes were inducible by phenobarbital. Total activity was very low in 3-day-old animals. Individual esterase activities rose at different rates during development; the enzyme focusing near pI 5.0 was about three times more active in adult females than in males. All microsomal esterases are located on the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum. </text>

      <text>Hippocampal afterdischarge interferes with storage of spatial information in a working memory test. In an attempt to impair spatial working memory by reversible functional blockade rather than by irreversible lesion of the hippocampus, eight male hooded rats were trained to asymptotic performance of 1.2 to 1.4 errors per trial in the spatial 12-choice apparatus ( Bure s et al. 1982), formally similar to the radial maze. The rats were implanted with hippocampal stimulating and recording electrodes, which were used for eliciting and monitoring hippocampal afterdischarge (HAD) lasting for at least 20 s. In Experiment 1, HAD elicited 1 or 10 min before testing increased the incidence of errors to 2.75 or 2.50 per trial, respectively, but the performance still remained above chance level (4.18). In Experiment 2, interruption of the trial by 1, 10, 20 and 30 min intervals inserted between choices 6 and 7 increased the incidence of errors in choices 7 to 12 to 1.0, 1.5, 2.1 and 2.5, respectively. HAD elicited immediately after choice 6 increased error incidence in the subsequent 6 choices performed after 1-min or 10-min intervals to 3.1 or 2.75, respectively, i.e. to the chance level of 3 errors in 6 choices. It is concluded that HAD elicits transient shortening of the memory span for newly acquired spatial information (anterograde effect) and erases the current spatial working memory record (retrograde effect). </text>

      <text>[In vitro studies of the thyroid gland regulation principles and their evaluation]. The free fractions of the thyroid hormone further the metabolism of the body cells and regulate the synthesis of the thyroid hormone. Once the level of FT3 and FT4 decreases. With the help of a liberation of the hormone stimulating the thyroid gland from the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland the lack of thyroid hormone is corrected. The synthesis and secretion of the thyroid gland stimulating hormone is induced by the thyreotropin releasing hormone which is given by the hypothalamus. Moreover, the organism is able as needed to carry out the monodiodation of LT4 to biologically active LT3 or biologically inactive so-called revers T3 (RT3). The estimation of thyroid gland stimulating hormone before and 30 minutes after intravenous application of thyreotropin releasing hormone has its main importance for the early recognition of a disturbance of the regulating circle hypophysis-thyroid gland, above all in the diagnosis of clinically not yet manifest clinical pictures, such as the latent hypothyreosis and the latent hyperthyreosis, respectively (Basedow hyperthyreosis and thyroidal autonomy). According to the questioning the estimations of the levels of the thyroid hormones and of the thyroid gland stimulating hormone should be used stepwise. </text>

      <text>Relationship of self-concept during late pregnancy to neonatal perception and parenting profile. Thirty-one gravidas were studied to examine the relationship between a woman's feelings about herself during late pregnancy, her perception of her newborn, and her profile of parenting. The Tennessee Self-Concept Scale was completed during the third trimester of pregnancy, the Neonatal Perception Inventory I at one-to-two days postpartum, and the Neonatal Perception Inventory II and the Michigan Screening Profile of Parenting at four-to-six weeks postpartum. When considered separately, no positive significant relationships were found between scores on these variables. However, all subjects with negative scores on both self-concept and neonatal perception had negative scores on at least two subscales of the parenting profile. </text>

      <text>Metabolic alterations in a noncachectic animal tumor system.  The increased energy expended by the host to synthesize substrate, which is utilized by the tumor, is a potential cause of cancer cachexia. In vivo glucose and alanine kinetics were examined by tracer methodology in a sarcoma-bearing rat model. The effects of 3-mercaptopicolinic acid, a potent inhibitor of gluconeogenesis, was also examined on this model. Both tumor-bearing (TB) and nontumor bearing (NTB) animals were gaining weight prior to study and the tumors were relatively small. The TB animals had significantly lower plasma glucose and higher blood lactic acid levels compared with NTB animals. After inhibition of gluconeogenesis, the plasma glucose decreased and the blood lactate increased significantly more in TB than NTB animals. The glucose turnover rate was significantly greater in TB compared with NTB animals, as was the rate of glucose recycling and the rate of gluconeogenesis (alanine leads to glucose), both energy demanding processes. These results suggest that the tumor-bearing animal, even prior to significant cachexia, has an excess demand for energy, the provision of which may be a significant factor in malignant cachexia. </text>

      <text>[Organization of pectoral muscle motor neurons in the rat. Contribution to the study of the axillary arch (Achselbogen)]. In spite of their role of the forelimb activity, the organization of the mammalian pectoral muscles remains unclear. In order to get more information, we have studied, qualitatively and quantitatively, the motor pools of the various pectoral muscles in the rat (musculus pectoralis major, musculus pectoralis minor and musculus panniculus carnosus). The method applied was the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase by the peripheral nerves supplying the various muscles. The results provided the precise localization within the ventral horn of the motor neurons from the pectoral muscles which were all in the most ventral part of the gray matter. Three distinct motor pools were observed, which confirms the functional identity of each muscle. The motor neurons of m. panniculus carnosus exhibited some particularities. They were 4 times more numerous than those from m. pectoralis major, they occupied the whole ventral edge of the ventral horn, from its medial part to its lateral tip. The cell size was different from that of the other muscles. These results were discussed, according to the role of this muscle, which links the forelimb to the whole trunk. In mammals, m. panniculus carnosus constitutes, with musculus latissimus dorsi, the axillary arch (Achselbogen). A small area of overlapping between the motor pools of these two muscles was observed. It was suggested that the muscular fibers from the axillary arch were innervated by the same, well-defined spinal area, independent of the muscle from which they originate. </text>

      <text>The inhibition of cultured myoblast differentiation by the simian virus 40 large T antigen occurs after myogenin expression and Rb up-regulation and is not exerted by transformation-competent cytoplasmic mutants.  We have investigated the mechanism by which the simian virus 40 large T antigen (SVLT) interferes with the differentiation of C2 myoblasts. SVLT mutants, defective either in the Rb binding site, near the N-terminal end, in a region that affects binding to p53, or in the nuclear transport signal, were also employed to determine whether the interference was especially dependent on these functional domains. It was found that wild-type (wt) SVLT strongly inhibited the terminal differentiation of mouse C2 myoblasts, but this arrest occurred only after the synthesis of myogenin, an initial step in biochemical differentiation. Neither the synthesis nor some basic activities of MyoD appeared to be affected by wt SVLT. In these transformants, mitogen depletion elicited an increase in the Rb level comparable to that in normal C2 cells; wt SVLT, however, promoted the phosphorylation of a large part of the induced Rb. Mutations affecting nuclear transport were far more critical for the ability to interfere with myogenic differentiation than were those affecting the transforming potential; cytoplasmic SVLT expression was fully compatible with the terminal differentiation of C2 cells, despite enabling them to grow in semisolid medium, thus showing that the myogenesis-inhibiting property can be dissociated from transforming competence. The remaining SVLT mutants presented different degrees of ability to inhibit differentiation (as shown by the expression of tissue-specific markers in transformants). The inhibiting mutants, including the Rb binding site mutant, were able to promote a higher state of Rb phosphorylation than that observed in either normal cells or cytoplasmic-SVLT transformants. </text>

      <text>A transcript from the long terminal repeats of a murine retrovirus associated with trans activation of cellular genes.  Infection of human or murine cells with murine leukemia viruses rapidly increases the expression of a number of genes that belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily and are involved in T-lymphocyte activation, including the class I major histocompatibility complex antigens. We have reported recently that the long terminal repeat (LTR) of Moloney murine leukemia virus encodes a trans activator which induces transcription and expression of class I major histocompatibility complex genes and certain cytokine genes. The portion of the LTR responsible for trans activation was mapped by deletions to lie within the U3 region. We demonstrate here that a transcript is initiated within the U3 region and that its presence correlates with the trans-activating activity. Analysis of the LTR region reveals a potential internal promoter element for RNA polymerase III transcription within the U3 region. Studies with polymerase inhibitors suggest that this LTR transcript, designated let (LTR-encoded trans activator), is a product of RNA polymerase III. The mechanisms whereby RNA leukemia viruses cause lymphoid neoplasia after a long latent period have been extensively studied but are only partially understood. The region of the LTR identified here as being important in trans activation has recently been shown to be a critical determinant of the leukemogenicity and latency of Moloney murine leukemia virus. These findings suggest a novel mechanism of retrovirus-induced activation of cellular gene expression, potentially contributing to leukemogenesis. </text>

      <text>Anti-transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta antibodies inhibit breast cancer cell tumorigenicity and increase mouse spleen natural killer cell activity. Implications for a possible role of tumor cell/host TGF-beta interactions in human breast cancer progression.  TGF-beta effects on angiogenesis, stroma formation, and immune function suggest its possible involvement in tumor progression. This hypothesis was tested using the 2G7 IgG2b, which neutralizes TGF-beta 1, -beta 2, and -beta 3, and the MDA-231 human breast cancer cell line. Inoculation of these cells in athymic mice decreases mouse spleen natural killer (NK) cell activity. Intraperitoneal injections of 2G7 starting 1 d after intraperitoneal inoculation of tumor cells suppressed intraabdominal tumor and lung metastases, whereas the nonneutralizing anti-TGF-beta 12H5 IgG2a had no effect. 2G7 transiently inhibited growth of established MDA-231 subcutaneous tumors. Histologically, both 2G7-treated and control tumors were identical. Intraperitoneal administration of 2G7 resulted in a marked increase in mouse spleen NK cell activity. 2G7 did not inhibit MDA-231 primary tumor or metastases formation, nor did it stimulate NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in beige NK-deficient nude mice. Finally, serum-free conditioned medium from MDA-231 cells inhibited the NK cell activity of human blood lymphocytes. This inhibition was blocked by the neutralizing anti-TGF-beta 2G7 antibody but not by a nonspecific IgG2. These data support a possible role for tumor cell TGF-beta in the progression of mammary carcinomas by suppressing host immune surveillance. </text>

      <text>Enhanced DNA-binding activity of a Stat3-related protein in cells transformed by the Src oncoprotein.  Cytokines and growth factors induce tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) that directly activate gene expression. Cells stably transformed by the Src oncogene tyrosine kinase were examined for STAT protein activation. Assays of electrophoretic mobility, DNA-binding specificity, and antigenicity indicated that Stat3 or a closely related STAT family member was constitutively activated by the Src oncoprotein. Induction of this DNA-binding activity was accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 and correlated with Src transformation. These findings demonstrate that Src can activate STAT signaling pathways and raise the possibility that Stat3 contributes to oncogenesis by Src. </text>

      <text>Bicistronic retroviral vector reveals capacity of v-erbA to induce erythroleukemia and to co-operate with v-myb.  Previous studies have shown that v-erbA and v-myb can induce the proliferation of avian erythroid cells in culture. To study the combined effects of v-erbA and v-myb, the two oncogenes were engineered into a retrovirus bicistronic vector with an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) or into a vector with a splice acceptor (SPL). This allowed coexpression of the two proteins and a comparison with the same vector containing either v-erbA or v-myb only. Both the erbA IRES and the erbA/myb IRES virus constructs transformed erythroid cells after infection of bone marrow or blastoderm cultures. The erbA/myb IRES virus exhibited a 5-10-fold higher transformed colony forming efficiency than the erbA IRES virus in the blastoderm assay. Surprisingly, when injected into chicken embryos in the presence of helper virus, both viruses induced an erythroleukemia in about half of the animals. In contrast, no leukemia was observed with a myb IRES virus, with spliced vectors containing v-erbA alone or v-erbA in combination with v-myb, nor with erbA IRES and erbA/myb IRES viruses produced in the absence of helper virus. The average latency of leukemia induction was shorter for the erbA/myb IRES virus (3.5 weeks) than for the erbA IRES virus (5 weeks). Nevertheless, for both viruses the leukemic blasts retained full factor dependence for growth. These results show that v-erbA is capable of inducing an erythroleukemia when expressed by a high titer bicistronic retrovirus under conditions of virus spreading and that its in vitro and in vivo transforming potential can be enhanced by v-myb. </text>

      <text>VEGF165 expressed by a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus vector induces angiogenesis in vivo. To evaluate the concept that localized delivery of angiogenic factors via virus-mediated gene transfer may be useful in the treatment of ischemic disorders, the replication-deficient adenovirus (Ad) vector AdCMV.VEGF165 (where CMV is cytomegalovirus and VEGF is vascular endothelial growth factor) containing the cDNA for human VEGF165, a secreted endothelial cell-specific angiogenic growth factor, was constructed. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and rat aorta smooth muscle cells (RASMCs) infected with AdCMV.VEGF165 (5 and 20 plaque-forming units [pfu] per cell) demonstrated VEGF mRNA expression and protein secretion into the supernatant. Furthermore, the conditioned medium from these cells enhanced vascular permeability in vivo. In contrast, neither VEGF mRNA nor secreted protein was found in uninfected HUVECs or RASMCs or in cells infected with the control vector AdCMV.beta gal (where beta gal is beta-galactosidase). Assessment of starved HUVECs at 14 days demonstrated sixfold more cells for AdCMV.VEGF165-infected HUVECs (20 pfu per cell) than for either infected or uninfected control cells. RASMC proliferation was unaffected by infection with AdCMV.VEGF165. When plated in 2% serum on dishes precoated with reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel), HUVECs infected with AdCMV.VEGF165 (20 pfu per cell) differentiated into capillary-like structures. Under similar conditions, both uninfected HUVECs and HUVECs infected with AdCMV.beta gal did not differentiate. To evaluate the ability of AdCMV.VEGF165 to function in vivo, either AdCMV. VEGF165 or AdCMV.beta gal (2 x 10(10) pfu) was resuspended in 0.5 mL Matrigel and injected subcutaneously into mice. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated VEGF in the tissues surrounding the Matrigel plugs containing AdCMV.VEGF165 up to 3 weeks after injection, whereas no VEGF was found in the control plugs with AdCMV.beta gal. Two weeks after injection, there was histological evidence of neovascularization in the tissues surrounding the Matrigel containing AdCMV.VEGF165, whereas no significant angiogenesis was observed in response to AdCMV.beta gal. Furthermore, the Matrigel plugs with AdCMV.VEGF165 demonstrated hemoglobin content fourfold higher than the plugs with AdCMV.beta gal. Together, these in vitro and in vivo studies are consistent with the concept that Ad vectors may provide a useful strategy for efficient local delivery of VEGF165 in the treatment of ischemic diseases. </text>

      <text>Comparative immunohistochemical study of primary and metastatic carcinomas of the liver. Distinguishing primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from metastatic carcinomas to the liver is often difficult, if not impossible, particularly in needle biopsy and fine-needle aspiration specimens. In an attempt to identify a specific immunohistochemical profile that would distinguish HCC from metastatic carcinomas, we studied 56 HCCs, 8 cholangiocarcinomas, and 24 metastatic adenocarcinomas with monoclonal antibodies to alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), keratin (AE1, AE3, and CAM5.2), Leu-M1, human milk fat globule (HMFG-2), tumor-associated glycoprotein-72(B72.3), epithelial specific membrane antigen (Ber-EP4), and BCA-225 (CU-18). Both monoclonal and polyclonal (mCEA and pCEA) antibodies to carcinoembryonic antigen also were used. Metastatic adenocarcinomas were often positive for CU-18(71%), Leu-M1 (75%), B72.3 (50%), HMFG-2 (67%), Ber-EP4(83%) and mCEA(71%). Using these antibodies, the frequency of positivity for HCC was 9%, 16%, 11%, 20%, 36%, and 11%, respectively. CU-18 was the only monoclonal antibody in which there was a significant difference in positive rates between HCC and metastatic adenocarcinomas. Most HCCs (71%) revealed a bile canalicular staining pattern with pCEA. Because this staining pattern was absent in metastatic carcinomas, pCEA appears to be useful in confirming a diagnosis of HCC. AE1, AE3 and CAM5.2 antibodies were not useful in distinguishing HCC from metastatic carcinomas. Each cholangiocarcinoma shared a staining profile similar to that of metastatic carcinomas. </text>

      <text>Differential effects of carbachol on calcium entry and release in CHO cells expressing the m3 muscarinic receptor. Calcium signalling was examined in CHO-k1 cells that stably express the m3 subtype of the muscarinic receptor. The calcium indicator Fura-2 was retained in these cells only in the presence of probenecid (1 mM), suggesting that Fura-2 efflux was mediated by an organic anion transporter. The addition of carbachol (CCh) to Fura-2 loaded cells in suspension caused a rapid transient increase in intracellular calcium [Ca]i followed by a smaller sustained plateau phase. The transient rise in [Ca]i was dose-dependent with a threshold response of 89 +/- 18 nM above baseline with 10 nM CCh and a maximum stimulation of 734 +/- 46 nM with 10 microM CCh. This phase was accompanied by a similar dose-dependent stimulation of total inositol phosphate production and was assumed to be generated by release from intracellular stores of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The sustained increase in [Ca]i was generated by entry from the extracellular bath since it was blocked by pretreatment with La3+ (1 microM) and was absent when bath calcium was chelated with EGTA. This phase was not dependent on CCh dose, and a stimulation of [Ca]i of approximately 90 nM above baseline was observed with CCh concentrations between 50 nM and 10 microM. With this dose range, the rate of Mn2+ quenching of Fura-2 at the Ca-insensitive excitation wavelength of 360 nm was likewise maximally stimulated. At lower CCh concentrations (10-50 nM), it was clear that the activation of Ca entry could not be dissociated from a threshold release of Ca from intracellular stores. The phorbol ester PMA, which uncouples the muscarinic receptor from phospholipase C, reduced the transient rise in [Ca]i by approximately 50% with little or no effect on Ca entry at higher CCh levels (&gt; or = 1 microM). At lower CCh concentrations (&lt; or = 100 nM) however, pretreatment with PMA completely blocked all Ca mobilization and supports the contention that Ca entry is coupled to Ca release from stores or to store depletion. The emptying of inositol trisphosphate-sensitive stores with thapsigargin (10 nM) stimulated Ca entry and also the rate of Mn2+ quenching. Store depletion by incubation in Ca-free media likewise stimulated Mn2+ uptake without a rise in [Ca]i. Our data are therefore consistent with a 'capacitative' coupling model, whereby the activation of the plasma membrane receptor leads to an InsP3-induced change in the degree of filling of the ER Ca pool.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </text>

      <text>Modulation of apoptosis in human myeloid leukemic cells by GM-CSF.  Apoptosis (programmed cell death) regulates cell population size. To determine the mechanisms whereby hematopoietic growth factors (HGFs) modulate apoptosis in human myeloid leukemic cells, we evaluated the roles of protein and mRNA synthesis for altering apoptosis in growth factor-stimulated vs. quiescent leukemic TF1 cells. Lysates of cells from the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-dependent myeloid leukemic cell line TF1 were separated into high molecular weight (HMW) pellets of intact DNA and supernatants of fragmented low MW (LMW) DNA, and the DNA purified from these fractions was quantified. In the absence of both GM-CSF and fetal bovine serum (FBS), 70% of the DNA was fragmented after 3 days in culture, with a characteristic apoptotic ladder-like pattern on agarose gel electrophoresis, whereas this proportion had initially been &lt; 5%. In contrast, less than 5% of the DNA was fragmented in cells incubated with GM-CSF plus FBS or GM-CSF alone. Delayed addition of GM-CSF, but not FBS, permitted partial rescue of the cells, inhibiting increasing rates of accumulation of fragmented DNA. When the macro-molecular synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) or actinomycin D (Act D) was present for 26 hours in the absence of GM-CSF and FBS, apoptosis was inhibited. In contrast, in the presence of GM-CSF or FBS, apoptosis was enhanced upon addition of CHX or Act D. The latter effect persisted even with the late addition of CHX. These findings indicate that disparate mechanisms of enhancing or inhibiting apoptosis exist in myeloid leukemic cells related to environmental conditions, including HGF-regulated cellular synthesis of distinct proteins and mRNA. </text>

      <text>Effects of doxycycline on in vitro growth, migration, and gelatinase activity of breast carcinoma cells. Metastatic disease is one of the major causes of death from cancer in human beings. Several enzyme systems have been implicated in the metastatic process, but the metalloproteinases (MPs) appear to be the major group involved in most instances of neoplastic invasion. Increased MP activity has been correlated with the metastatic potential of many cancers, including breast cancer. MPs also play a role in tumor angiogenesis. Tetracyclines are antimicrobial agents that can suppress MP activity in a variety of tissues, including gingiva, bone, and cartilage. Several reports have indicated that tetracyclines can suppress tumor MPs as well. A synthetic tetracycline, doxycycline, inhibits migration of human MDA-MB-435 breast adenocarcinoma cells through a reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel), an assay used as an in vitro surrogate for the in vivo process of tumor invasion through basement membranes. Additionally, doxycycline diminishes the proliferation of this breast cancer cell line and also decreases its gelatinolytic activity, as determined by gel zymography. </text>

      <text>Transforming growth factor beta 1 promotes spontaneous transformation of cultured rat liver epithelial cells.  The neoplastic transformation of cultured rat liver epithelial cells by various means has consistently been associated with the development of resistance to the mito-inhibitory effect of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), suggesting that such phenotype plays a mechanistic role during the transformation of these cells. We have studied the induction of the "TGF-beta-resistant" phenotype in a clonal strain of early passage WB-F344 normal cultured rat liver epithelial cells, the proliferation of which was markedly inhibited by TGF-beta. The control WB cells in continuous culture slowly developed TGF-beta resistance. However, when the same cells were exposed to step-wise increases of TGF-beta concentration in their culture medium, the development of TGF-beta resistance was accelerated. Cells which had been grown in medium containing 1 ng/ml TGF-beta developed colony-forming capacity in soft agar containing epidermal growth factor. Cells which were grown in media containing 5 and 10 ng/ml TGF-beta demonstrated a low level of colony-forming efficiency in soft agar medium without added epidermal growth factor and tumorigenicity in isogeneic rats. These TGF-beta-resistant cells also exhibited progressively increasing levels of expression of the c-fos and and myc mRNA, and increased resistance to the cytotoxicity of Adriamycin and melphalan. The latter phenomenon was accompanied by an increase in the mdr-1 mRNA expression, cellular glutathione level, and glutathione S-transferase activity. The results suggest that chronic exposure to high concentration of TGF-beta promotes the spontaneous neoplastic transformation of cultured rat liver epithelial cells, and that this process may represent one of the mechanisms of cellular adaptation for induction of the multidrug-resistant phenotype during the carcinogenesis of epithelial cells. </text>

      <text>Appetite regulation by serotoninergic mechanisms and effects of d-fenfluramine. In this literature review, evidence is presented for the theory that the neurotransmitter, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT), in medial hypothalamic centres is an important regulator for appetite and for the selection of major food constituents. High local levels of 5HT cause a reduction of appetite and a preference for protein, low levels the opposite. The main antagonistic system is noradrenergic. The drug d-fenfluramine mimics the effects of 5HT by releasing 5HT from serotoninergic nerve endings and inhibiting its neuronal re-uptake. Further experimental data prove that a high-carbohydrate, low-protein diet promotes uptake of serum tryptophan in the brain and its conversion into 5HT. Hence, this serotoninergic system may function as a self-regulatory mechanism. In patients with decreased peripheral insulin sensitivity, the system may be disturbed, causing overconsumption of carbohydrates. This is sometimes compulsive ("carbohydrate craving"). It may be presumed that in the treatment of obesity, in addition to the use of serotoninergic drugs, successes with reducing diets may be enhanced by including periods of high-carbohydrate, low-protein intake. It would be worthwhile to explore whether similar alimentary self-regulatory mechanisms of neurotransmitter function exist in other regulatory systems. </text>

      <text>[Preliminary results of observing 18 cases of retinoblastoma carried within the international research program RICS]. In the years 1988-1989, the Ophthalmological Clinic in Cracow took part in the International Research Programme on Retinoblastoma as one of 28 clinical centres in 14 countries. The study included 18 children with retinoblastoma, in most cases in the advanced stadium of the disease. As a rule, the eyes filled with tumours were enucleated, and the less advanced cases were treated with combined methods applying radiation with 60Co plaques with xenon arc photocoagulation, cryopexy, and chemotherapy. In 18 treated children 23 eyes were enucleated (in 5 children both eyes, in 6 children with bilateral retinoblastoma 1 eye, and 7 eyes in all unilateral cases). Six eyes with less advanced lesions were treated with combined methods. One child died because of metastases to the brain. The obtained data reveal that retinoblastoma is diagnosed too late, which decreases the chance of cure and causes great danger for the life of the child. </text>

      <text>Identification of latency-associated transcripts that map antisense to the ICP4 homolog gene of Marek's disease virus.  Two small RNAs (0.9 and 0.75 kb), named Marek's disease virus (MDV) small RNAs (MSRs) and a 10-kb RNA, all of which map antisense to the MDV ICP4 homolog gene, have been readily detected in MDCC-MSB1 MDV-transformed T-lymphoblastoid cells. These RNAs were not detectable in reticuloendotheliosis virus-transformed T cells. When MDV was reactivated by treatment of lymphoblastoid cells with 25 micrograms of iododeoxyuridine per ml, the relative levels of the transcripts decreased. These RNAs were not detected by Northern (RNA) hybridization in productively infected chicken embryo fibroblasts 48 h postinfection; however, they were apparent 140 h postinfection. By using Northern hybridization, RNase protection assays, and primer extension analysis, the MSRs were determined to map antisense to the predicted translational start site of the ICP4 homolog gene. The conclusion most consistent with the data is that the two MSRs are overlapping, spliced RNAs. Both small RNAs contain a latency promoter binding factor consensus recognition sequence located toward their 5' ends as well as two potential ICP4 recognition consensus sequences, one in each orientation. The region contains a number of small open reading frames on each side and within the MSRs. Although the exact endpoints are unknown, the large 10-kb species spans the entire ICP4 homolog region. We believe that this group of RNAs, which map antisense to the ICP4 homolog gene, are latency-associated transcripts of MDV. </text>

      <text>Increased expression of specific protein tyrosine phosphatases in human breast epithelial cells neoplastically transformed by the neu oncogene.  Protein tyrosine phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is a fundamental mechanism in the regulation of cell proliferation and neoplastic transformation; this metabolic process is modulated by the opposing activities of protein tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases). While the role of protein tyrosine kinases has been examined extensively in human breast tumorigenesis, the role of PTPases in this process is virtually unknown. To address this issue, an activated neu oncogene was introduced into an immortalized nontumorigenic human breast epithelial cell line (184B5). This resulted in a substantial increase in P185neu expression, which led to the formation of progressively growing carcinomas after such cells were inoculated into athymic nude mice. Importantly, a striking increase in the expression of specific PTPases, LAR and PTP1B, was observed in 3 independently neu transformed cell lines and their derived tumors. This elevation was verified at both the mRNA and protein levels. TC-PTP PTPase expression was only slightly increased in these neu transformed cells, and no expression of CD45 PTPase was observed. The level of neu expression, as well as the differential expression between P185neu and LAR/PTP1B, directly correlated with tumorigenicity. Furthermore, rat mammary carcinomas with elevated neu expression (neu-induced) also had sharply elevated LAR-PTPase expression when compared to rat mammary carcinomas with little or no neu expression (7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene induced); the level of expression of LAR PTPase was directly correlated with the level of neu expression. Thus, our results provide the first evidence that, in human breast carcinoma cells and in rat mammary carcinomas that have an induced increase in neu expression, a consistent and substantial increase in the expression of specific PTPases occurs. The relationship between P185neu-protein tyrosine kinase expression and specific PTPase expression may play a critical role in human breast tumorigenesis. </text>

      <text>Epilepsy in Down syndrome: clinical aspects and possible mechanisms. Although epilepsy is more common in persons with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) than in the general population, the mechanisms by which seizures are generated in this population have received little attention. It is likely that this increased seizure susceptibility is due to a combination of medical risk factors and inherent neurologic abnormalities characteristic of Down syndrome. In this review clinical aspects of seizures among individuals with Down syndrome were described and possible mechanisms by which the trisomy 21 brain may generate seizures were explored. </text>

      <text>In vivo effects of insulin on tumor and skeletal muscle glucose metabolism in patients with lymphoma.  BACKGROUND: The anabolic properties of insulin have been suggested for use to reverse malnutrition associated with cancer. The host and tumor sensitivities to insulin are critical for such treatments, which aim to improve patient nutrition. The authors studied insulin effects on tumor and skeletal muscle metabolism with 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) and positron emission tomography (PET). METHODS: Six patients with lymphoma twice underwent [18F]FDG-PET imaging: once after fasting overnight and once during euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. The dynamic uptake of the glucose analogue [18F]FDG was measured in diseased nodes and upper arm skeletal muscle in both metabolic states. The [18F]FDG uptake in muscle and the whole body glucose use during euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp were compared with those of weight-matched healthy subjects studied under similar circumstances. RESULTS: In lymphomatous tissue, [18F]FDG uptake rates were similar in overnight fasting and euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (38 +/- 10 versus 41 +/- 9 mumol/100 g/minute, not significant), whereas glucose uptake in skeletal muscle was increased by insulin (1.7 +/- 0.2 versus 3.8 +/- 0.5 mumol/100 g/minute, P = 0.012). Both basal (2.3 +/- 0.2 mumol/100 g/minute, P = 0.061) and insulin-stimulated (8.5 +/- 1.9 mumol/100 g/minute, P = 0.055) skeletal arm muscle glucose uptake rates were higher in control subjects than in patients. Whole body glucose use was 55% lower in patients than in control subjects (17 +/- 3 mumol/kg/minute versus 38 +/- 3 mumol/kg/minute, P = 0.002), consistent with insulin resistance in cancer. CONCLUSIONS: We found that insulin does not induce major changes in glucose uptake of lymphomatous tissue. Although insulin sensitivity of skeletal muscle was also reduced in patients with lymphoma, the net insulin effect may counteract imbalance between glucose uptake of tumor and muscle, offering a potential means to circumvent at least some metabolic abnormalities found in cancer. </text>

      <text>Kinins contribute to the improvement of insulin sensitivity during treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Although angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and alpha 1-blockers have been reported to improve insulin sensitivity, their mechanisms of action have not been elucidated. To investigate the role of kinins in insulin sensitivity, we treated 4-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats with either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril), an alpha 1-blocker (doxazosin), or an angiotensin II antagonist (losartan) for 3 weeks. A control group received no drugs. In addition, 18 rats treated with enalapril or doxazosin received a simultaneous administration of a kinin antagonist (Hoe 140). Glucose clamp testing was performed in each group. Enalapril (128 +/- 1 mmHg) and doxazosin (132 +/- 2 mmHg) decreased mean blood pressure compared with control levels (148 +/- 1 mmHg) (P &lt; .01). The glucose requirement for the clamp test during the administration of enalapril (25.8 +/- 0.5 mg/kg per minute) or doxazosin (28.6 +/- 0.7 mg/kg per minute) was higher than that of the control group (19.8 +/- 0.5 mg/kg per minute) (P &lt; .05). Although Hoe 140 did not alter the glucose requirement of doxazosin (27.8 +/- 0.5 mg/kg per minute), it decreased that of enalapril (22.6 +/- 0.9 mg/kg per minute) (P &lt; .05) without affecting the changes in mean blood pressure induced by enalapril. In addition, losartan decreased mean blood pressure but did not affect the glucose requirement. Thus, the improvement in insulin sensitivity produced by an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor is mostly dependent on kinins but not on angiotensin II antagonism, and an alpha 1-blocker improves insulin sensitivity irrespective of kinins. </text>

      <text>Distribution and predictors of depressive symptoms in osteoarthritis. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and correlates of depressive symptoms in a sample of elderly persons with osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: Secondary analysis of cross sectional interview data from 108 community living persons age 50 or over who met American College of Rheumatology clinical criteria for OA of the hip and/or knee. RESULTS: The prevalence of substantial depressive symptomatology appeared to be no greater than would be expected in the general population for this age group. However, persons currently under a physician's care for OA were significantly more depressed than those not under care, and, with the exception of those who had post-high school education, depression was a better predictor of being under care than OA symptoms. The direct and interactive effects of 3 variables--education, age and self-perceived impact of the OA problem--were found to explain 40% of variance in depression scores in the total sample and 50% among those currently receiving care. Younger and less educated subjects had relatively more depressive symptoms and, furthermore, in this subgroup the correlation between OA impact and depression was high. CONCLUSIONS: The importance of assessing depression in persons who seek care for OA is supported. Furthermore, our results suggest that the observed relationship between education and arthritis outcomes could be mediated, at least in part, by depression. </text>

      <text>Effect of 1-alkylpyrrolidine N-oxides on energy metabolism of cancer cells. The main purpose of the present investigation was to study the effect of a homologous series of 1-alkylpyrrolidine N-oxides on ATP-producing processes in Ehrlich ascites and L1210 murine leukemia cells. The effect on aerobic glucose consumption, lactic acid formation, content of total (T-SH) and non-protein thiol groups (NP-SH), endogenous respiration and the level of ATP in tumor cells incubated in vitro was investigated. 1-Tetradecylpyrrolidine N-oxide (TPNO), one of the most active compounds, immediately after addition to the suspension of Ehrlich cells in an ice bath, decreased the level of ATP to the same extent over the whole concentration range. After 2 h incubation at 37 degrees C the drop in the ATP level was lower. The decrease in ATP level might be explained through the interaction of the amine oxide with the cell membrane integrity. </text>

      <text>Chelation treatment of neurological Wilson's disease. The results of chelation treatment of 137 patients presenting with neurological Wilson's disease are described, together with the more commonly observed toxic reactions to the various drugs employed. Fifty-seven patients made an excellent response to treatment and became symptom free. Thirty-six patients made a good recovery, but were left with some minor neurological deficit. Twenty-four patients had a poor response: although the disease process was arrested they were left more or less disabled. Twenty patients died: nine had little or no treatment, but 11 died despite apparently adequate chelation therapy. There was no obvious reason for this failure. The liver copper level was estimated in six of these patients: it was still significantly elevated in only one, but in all four in whom it was possible to make the determination, the concentration of copper in the basal ganglia was in excess of 45 micrograms/g wet weight. It was not apparent why adequate therapy failed to remove copper from the brains of these patients. There was no obvious clinical, histological or biochemical indicator of failure to respond to treatment. Initial deterioration before improvement was seen in 30 patients: the prognosis for a useful recovery was not necessarily worse than that in patients who did not show this phenomenon. </text>

      <text>Transformation-associated cytokine 9E3/CEF4 is chemotactic for chicken peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  9E3/CEF4, which is released from transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF), is a member of the platelet factor 4 family of inflammatory proteins and may be the avian homolog of interleukin-8. Since the function of 9E3/CEF4 is unknown, we examined the effect of the protein on mitogenicity and chemotaxis, as well as its expression, in fibroblasts and peripheral blood cells. 9E3/CEF4 mRNA was expressed in chicken peripheral blood monocytes, and its expression was stimulated by incubation of the monocytes with lipopolysaccharide or phorbol myristic acetate. Boyden double-membrane analysis of chemotaxis showed that 9E3/CEF4 was chemotactic for chicken peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as well as for heterophils. Untransformed CEF and CEF transformed with Rous sarcoma virus also migrated to 9E3/CEF4 protein, as measured by Boyden single-membrane analysis. 9E3/CEF4 was slightly mitogenic for CEF, causing a doubling of [3H]thymidine uptake when added to serum-starved CEF.9E3/CEF4 was found associated not only with the cell and in the culture medium of Rous sarcoma virus-transformed CEF but also with the extracellular matrix. The in vivo role of 9E3/CEF4 may be involved with chemotaxis and metastasis, rather than with direct stimulation of mitogenicity. </text>

      <text>Vitamins regulate gene expression and induce differentiation and growth inhibition in cancer cells. Their relevance in cancer prevention.  Although several hypotheses for human carcinogenesis have been proposed, the specific genetic changes that cause normal cells to become cancer cells have not been identified. In spite of uncertainties regarding the mechanisms of carcinogenesis, several vitamins such as beta-carotene and vitamins A, C, and E, which can reduce the risk of cancer, have been identified, using animal and in vitro models of carcinogenesis. These studies have led to a hypothesis that the supplemental intake of these vitamins may reduce the risk of cancer. This hypothesis in humans can be tested only by intervention trials that are in progress. Prospective and retrospective case-controlled experimental designs are not suitable for testing the above hypothesis. The fact that some vitamins induce cell differentiation and/or growth inhibition in tumor cells in culture suggests that the use of these vitamins in cancer prevention has a cellular basis. In addition to having a direct effect on tumor cells, vitamins such as alpha-tocopheryl succinate and beta-carotene enhance the effect of other agents that induce differentiation in tumor cells. Some vitamins like beta-carotene, retinoic acid, alpha-tocopheryl succinate, and vitamin D also regulate the expressions of certain oncogenes and cellular genes. These are exciting new functions of vitamins that nobody could have predicted only a few years ago. </text>

      <text>Increased nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 messenger RNA expression and absence of mutations in colon carcinomas of low and high metastatic potential.  BACKGROUND: The murine nm23 gene suppresses the metastatic behavior of malignant rodent tumor lines, and reduced nm23 expression correlates with increased likelihood of lymph node metastases in human breast cancers. More recent data have demonstrated the existence of two human nm23 gene homologues, nm23-H1 and nm23-H2, and have shown that deletion of nm23-H1 alleles occurs in some colon carcinomas associated with poor prognosis. These findings suggest that nm23-H1 encodes for suppression of colon carcinoma metastasis. In contrast, we have previously reported that total nm23 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression is increased to similar levels in colon tumors of both high and low metastatic potential. PURPOSE: This study was designed to reconcile our previous findings with the recent report of nm23-H1 allelic deletion in human colon cancers associated with poor prognosis. Our purpose was to examine human colon cancers for inactivation of two candidate metastasis suppressor genes, nm23-H1 and nm23-H2, either by mutation or by loss of gene transcription. METHODS: We used ribonuclease protection assays to analyze human colon tumors for the level of nm23-H1 (43 samples) and nm23-H2 (41 samples) transcript (mRNA) expression and the presence of mutations that could inactivate potential suppressor function. RESULTS: We detected only wild-type nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 mRNA. Expression of nm23-H1 mRNA increased in 33 of 41 colon tumors, and expression of nm23-H2 mRNA was elevated in 28 of 41 colon tumors relative to that in matched normal mucosa. Increases in these mRNA levels were similar in tumors of both low and high metastatic potential. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that, despite correlation of nm23-H1 allelic deletions with colon cancers associated with poor prognosis, nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 alleles do not directly mediate metastasis suppression in colon carcinoma. Our results leave unexplained the observation that nm23-H1 allelic deletion correlates with metastatic potential of colon carcinomas. IMPLICATIONS: These findings also contrast with the demonstration of nm23 metastasis suppressor activity in murine melanoma and with the correlation of loss of nm23 expression in breast cancer with poor prognosis. It may be that metastasis suppression by the nm23 gene is a tissue-specific phenomenon. </text>

      <text>E mu-bcl-2 transgene facilitates spontaneous transformation of early pre-B and immunoglobulin-secreting cells but not T cells.  To assess the lymphoid tumorigenic potential of bcl-2, mice of five independent strains expressing a bcl-2 transgene in B and/or T cells were monitored for disease up to 12 months of age. Lymphoma prevalence was minimal in the T lineage but significant, although low (3-15%), in the B lineage. The principal types of tumors were plasmacytomas secreting immunoglobulin and novel lymphomas that expressed markers such as Sca-1, CD4, Thy-1, CD34 and CD45(B220), consistent with an origin very early in B-lymphoid development. Rearrangement of the c-myc gene was common in the plasmacytomas, implying a synergistic role for myc and bcl-2 in their etiology, but was not detected in the lymphomas. </text>

      <text>[Prehospital service in Denmark]. In Denmark, emergency ambulances are dispatched by 41 centres manned either by trained firemen (in Copenhagen) or policemen (outside Copenhagen). In 1990, emergency ambulance calls totalled 284,000. Utilisation of emergency ambulance services increases with urbanisation. A doctor-manned ambulance is in operation in Copenhagen, and in some other large towns anaesthesiology and intensive care teams can be dispatched from hospital to give on-the-spot care. In less populated areas, some general practitioners give advanced life-support. Although many areas are serviced by ambulances equipped with defibrillators, the majority of patients receive only basic life-support from ambulance personnel. New initiatives resulting from a recent report by a commission appointed by central authorities, and focused on prehospital treatment, are expected to improve the service by raising the level of training given to ambulance personnel. </text>

      <text>Tumorigenic activity of rho genes from Aplysia californica.  rho genes have been found in both lower and higher eucaryotes. They code for proteins of 21 kDa, highly conserved in evolution, which belong to the superfamily of ras GTPases. Among the members of this superfamily there are proteins with a regulatory function, such as ras, and proteins involved in vesicular trafficking, such as the family of rab proteins. We have investigated the putative role of rho proteins from Aplysia californica as transforming GTPases utilizing the wild-type and a Val-14 mutant, equivalent to the oncogenic Val-12 mutation of ras genes found in animal and human tumors. Over-expression of either rho gene was sufficient to confer anchorage- and serum-independent growth. Moreover, when introduced into nude mice, selected clones generated from either gene were able to induce tumors, although those carrying the mutated version were more efficient. Pathological analysis indicated that generated tumors corresponded to well-differentiated fibrosarcomas with distinct and intersecting bundles and spindle cells. By contrast, ras-induced tumors were poorly differentiated fibrosarcomas. Thus, our results indicate that under appropriate conditions rho genes function as oncogenes and may have a role in the regulation of proliferation in fibroblast cells. </text>

      <text>Pancreatic somatostatin-secreting gangliocytic paraganglioma with lymph node metastases.  Gangliocytic paraganglioma (GPG) with local lymph node metastasis was found in the pancreas of a 74-yr-old female who presented with diarrhea, steatorrhea, vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain. A Whipple procedure led to a complete resolution of these symptoms and a return of an elevated stomatostatin level to normal. This is the first description of GPG in this location and the first endocrinologically active GPG. </text>

      <text>Cell surface binding characteristics correlate with consensus type I interferon enhanced activity. The binding characteristics of a genetically engineered consensus interferon with unusually high biologic activity were compared to the characteristics of recombinant interferon-alpha 2. Both interferon-alpha 2 and the consensus interferon produced typical biphasic Scatchard plots, indicating multiple independent binding sites. The consensus interferon, which exhibited a biologic potency more than 10-fold greater than all other type I interferons, also exhibited binding site affinities greater than those for IFN-alpha 2b. In addition, a larger number of high, and low-affinity cell surface sites were recognized by the consensus interferon, resulting in equivalent numbers of sites at reduced molar concentrations compared to IFN-a2b. Thus, at any given biologic activity, similar numbers of sites were bound by the consensus interferon and IFN-alpha 2, despite differences in their molar concentrations. No differences in internalization kinetics were identified between the two interferons, indicating that the differences in cell surface binding may be sufficient to produce the differences in biologic activity. </text>

      <text>Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 viral background plays a major role in development of resistance to protease inhibitors. The observed in vitro and in vivo benefit of combination treatment with anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) agents prompted us to examine the potential of resistance development when two protease inhibitors are used concurrently. Recombinant HIV-1 (NL4-3) proteases containing combined resistance mutations associated with BMS-186318 and A-77003 (or saquinavir) were either inactive or had impaired enzyme activity. Subsequent construction of HIV-1 (NL4-3) proviral clones containing the same mutations yielded viruses that were severely impaired in growth or nonviable, confirming that combination therapy may be advantageous. However, passage of BMS-186318-resistant HIV-1 (RF) in the presence of either saquinavir or SC52151, which represented sequential drug treatment, produced viable viruses resistant to both BMS-186318 and the second compound. The predominant breakthrough virus contained the G48V/A71T/V82A protease mutations. The clone-purified RF (G48V/A71T/V82A) virus, unlike the corresponding defective NL4-3 triple mutant, grew well and displayed cross-resistance to four distinct protease inhibitors. Chimeric virus and in vitro mutagenesis studies indicated that the RF-specific protease sequence, specifically the Ile at residue 10, enabled the NL4-3 strain with the triple mutant to grow. Our results clearly indicate that viral genetic background will play a key role in determining whether cross-resistance variants will arise. </text>

      <text>Stimulation of endothelial cell migration by vascular permeability factor/vascular endothelial growth factor through cooperative mechanisms involving the alphavbeta3 integrin, osteopontin, and thrombin. We have identified several mechanisms by which the angiogenic cytokine vascular permeability factor/vascular endothelial growth factor (VPF/VEGF) likely regulates endothelial cells (EC) migration. VPF/VEGF induced dermal microvascular EC expression of mRNAs encoding the alphav and beta3 integrin subunits resulting in increased levels of the alphavbeta3 heterodimer at the cell surface, and VPF/VEGF also induced mRNA encoding osteopontin (OPN), an alphavbeta3 ligand. OPN promoted EC migration in vitro; and VPF/VEGF induction of alphavbeta3 was accompanied by increased EC migration toward OPN. Because thrombin cleavage of OPN results in substantial enhancement of OPN's adhesive properties, and because VPF/VEGF promotes increased microvascular permeability leading to activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway, we also investigated whether VPF/VEGF facilitates thrombin cleavage of OPN in vivo. Consistent with this hypothesis, co-injection of VPF/VEGF together with OPN resulted in rapid cleavage of OPN by endogenous thrombin. Furthermore, in comparison with native OPN, thrombin-cleaved OPN stimulated a greater rate of EC migration in vitro, which was additive to the increased migration associated with induction of alpha v beta 3. Thus, these data demonstrate cooperative mechanisms for VPF/VEGF regulation of EC migration involving the alphavbeta3 integrin, the alphavbeta3 ligand OPN, and thrombin cleavage of OPN. These findings also illustrate an operational link between VPF/VEGF induction of EC gene expression and VPF/VEGF enhancement of microvascular permeability, suggesting that these distinct biological activities may act accordingly to stimulate EC migration during angiogenesis. </text>

      <text>Referral bias among health workers in studies using hospitalization as a proxy measure of the underlying incidence rate. Contacts with health services like hospitals or general practitioners are usually the only available proxy measure of incidence of disease in studies based on secondary data and differential referrals or care-seeking behavior often bias such proxy measures. In former analyses based on the Occupational Hospitalization Register in Denmark assisting nurses had high Standardized Hospitalization Ratios for many diseases. It was, however, suspected that it fully or partly was due to a referral bias or self-selection to hospital treatment rather than exposures to occupational hazards. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the referral bias hypothesis by comparing hospitalization and mortality data for health workers for a disease category with a high mortality. Cohorts of all gainfully employed 20- to 59-year-old Danes were formed in order to compare Standardized Mortality Ratios and Standardized Hospitalization Ratios of ischemic heart disease (IHD) in occupational groups. The follow-up period was 10 years. For most of the investigated occupational groups a similar disease pattern was found whether hospitalization or death was used as the outcome measure. In "nurse assistants" a statistically significant higher risk was, however, found using hospitalization due to IHD as the end point rather than mortality. Additional analysis did not support the hypothesis that the finding could be explained by differentiated hospitalization due to social factors. The true incidence rates of the disease need not be equally well described by proxy measures such as hospitalization diagnosis or death diagnosis in all occupational groups. Differential access to medical treatment in some groups may lead to bias when hospital data are used as proxy measures for the underlying incidence rates. </text>

      <text>The impact of multiskilling on quality of care. Hospital finances in the USA are in a crisis. While profits earned from the healthcare industry appear to be at an all-time high, individual hospitals are going bankrupt. Hospitals are not generating sufficient income to pay their expenses given how they have traditionally operated. Hence, we are witnessing the merger and consolidation of competitors, resulting in significantly fewer hospital beds in certain geographical areas. In addition to the strategy of closing hospital beds, severe budget restrictions are impacting upon all remaining services within the hospitals. </text>

      <text>Acetaminophen and hepatic dysfunction in infectious mononucleosis. Two family members developed severe hepatitic dysfunction in association with infectious mononucleosis and acetaminophen administration. Since severe hepatitis is an extremely rare complication of infectious mononucleosis, we postulate that the hepatic dysfunction was induced by acetaminophen. </text>

      <text>c-erb B2 overexpression decreases the benefit of adjuvant tamoxifen in early-stage breast cancer without axillary lymph node metastases.  PURPOSE: We studied retrospectively the interaction between c-erbB2 overexpression and adjuvant tomoxifen in node-negative breast cancer patients enrolled in the Gruppo Universitario Napoletano 1 (GUN-1) trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: c-erbB2, evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 145 of 173 patients randomly assigned to 2-year adjuvant tamoxifen or no further therapy, was considered overexpressed if greater than 10% of the cells showed specific membrane staining. The role of each prognostic variable and their independent effect were studied using the Cox model. Disease-free (DFS) and overall (OAS) survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: As of November 30, 1994, the median follow-up period was 12 years. c-erbB2 was overexpressed in 43 of 145 patients (29.7%), which directly correlated with tumor size and inversely with estrogen receptor (ER) level. At univariate analysis, overexpression of c-erbB2 did not affect either DFS or OAS; tamoxifen had a greater effect on reducing the risk of recurrence than of death. Addition of c-erbB2 to a multivariate Cox model that contained menopausal status, tumor size, nuclear grade, and treatment as covariates did not affect the significance of the model for DSF or OAS, whereas addition of the first-order interaction between c-erbB2 and tamoxifen was statistically significant both for DFS and OAS. The same result was obtained when the model contained ER status and ER-tamoxifen interaction. Indeed, adjuvant tamoxifen significantly prolonged DFS and OAS in c-erbB2-negative cases, whereas it had no effect on DFS and OAS in c-erbB2-positive patients. CONCLUSION: In early-stage breast cancer patients, overexpression of c-erbB2 is a marker of lack of efficacy of adjuvant tamoxifen. </text>

      <text>Gene transfer of naked DNA encoding for three isoforms of vascular endothelial growth factor stimulates collateral development in vivo. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a naturally secreted endothelial cell-specific mitogen. We investigated the hypothesis that naked DNA encoding for VEGF could be used in a strategy of arterial gene therapy to stimulate collateral artery development. Plasmid DNA encoding each of the three principal human VEGF isoforms (phVEGF121, phVEGF165, or phVEGF189) was applied to the hydrogel polymer coating of an angioplasty balloon and delivered percutaneously to one iliac artery of rabbits with operatively induced hindlimb ischemia. Compared with control animals transfected with LacZ, site-specific transfection of phVEGF resulted in augmented collateral vessel development documented by serial angiography, and improvement in calf blood pressure ratio (ischemic to normal limb), resting and maximum blood flow, and capillary to myocyte ratio. Similar results were obtained with phVEGF121, phVEGF165, and phVEGF189, which suggests that these isoforms are biologically equivalent with respect to in vivo angiogenesis. The fact that viral or other adjunctive vectors were not required further suggests that secreted gene products may have potential therapeutic utility even when the number of successfully transfected cells remains low. Arterial gene transfer of naked DNA encoding for a secreted angiogenic cytokine, thus, represents a potential alternative to recombinant protein administration for stimulating collateral vessel development. </text>

      <text>Induction of p18INK4c and its predominant association with CDK4 and CDK6 during myogenic differentiation. Terminal cell differentiation involves permanent withdrawal from the cell division cycle. The inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are potential molecules functioning to couple cell cycle arrest and cell differentiation. In murine C2C12 myoblast cells, G1 CDK enzymes (CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6) associate with four CDK inhibitors: p18INK4c, p19INK4d, p21, and p27Kip1. During induced myogenesis, p21 and its associated CDK proteins underwent an initial increase followed by a decrease as cells became terminally differentiated. The level of p27 protein gradually increased, but the amount of total associated CDK proteins remained unchanged. p19 protein decreased gradually during differentiation, as did its associated CDK4 protein. In contrast, p18 protein increased 50-fold, from negligible levels in proliferating myoblasts to clearly detectable levels within 8-12 h of myogenic induction. This initial rise was followed by a precipitous increase between 12 and 24 h postinduction, with p18 protein finally accumulating to its highest level in terminally differentiated cells. Induction of p18 correlated with increased and sequential complex formation--first increasing association with CDK6 and then with CDK4 over the course of myogenic differentiation. All of the CDK6 and half of the CDK4 were complexed with p18 in terminally differentiated C2C12 cells as well as in adult mouse muscle tissue. Finally, kinase activity of CDK2 and CDK4 decreases as C2C12 cells differentiate, whereas the CDK6 kinase activity is low in both proliferating myoblasts and differentiated myotubes. Our results indicate that p18 may play a critical role in causing and/or maintaining permanent cell cycle arrest associated with mature muscle formation. </text>

      <text>Functional model of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo using an isolated frog semicircular canal. Bull frogs posterior semicircular canals (psc) wee used to simulate the condition of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The psc was isolated in frog Ringer's solution, and the saccular otoconia were used as a responsible material to stimulate the cupula. When the otoconia were placed on the cupular surface to mimic the condition of cupulolithiasis, the psc ampullary nerve action potentials instantaneously changed according to the direction of the gravity produced by otoconia. When the otoconia were dropped into the canal to mimic the condition of moving otoconia in the canal, the action potentials changed together with the otoconial flow after a latent period. Both cupulolithiasis and moving otoconia are possibly valid mechanisms of BPPV, since they effectively stimulate the cupula. However, moving otoconia with a latent period would better explain clinical features of BPPV. </text>

      <text>Comparison of transformation by manganese sulfate and 5-azacytidine in Rat 6 cells overexpressing the c-myc oncogene.  Rat 6 cells are not transformed by treatment with the well-known carcinogens benzo[a]pyrene (BP) or N-methyl-N-nitro-N'-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Upon retroviral transduction of the mouse c-myc gene, Rat 6 cells showed mildly altered morphology and formed microcolonies in soft agar; furthermore, they could be transformed by BP and MNNG to form large colonies in agar (Hsiao et al. (1992) Mol. Carcinogenesis, 5, 140-154). In the current report, we tested the sensitivity of the c-myc-overexpressing cells (Rat 6/c-myc) to two additional chemicals: 5-azacytidine and MnSO4. These chemicals differ from the direct-acting mutagens tested previously. 5-Azacytidine, a potent DNA methylation inhibitor, induced growth of large colonies in soft agar cultures of Rat 6 or Rat 6/c-myc cells. On the other hand, MnSO4 only induced transformation in Rat 6/c-myc cells, but not the parental Rat 6 cells. Transformants induced by 5-azacytidine lost c-myc-induced apoptotic cell death, whereas MnSO4-induced transformants showed a higher degree of apoptosis than the parental Rat 6/c-myc cells. These results suggest that MnSO4 co-operates with overexpressed c-myc in inducing transformation, while 5-azacytidine transformation is independent of c-myc overexpression and may involve alterations in the regulation of apoptosis. </text>

      <text>Procedural memory stimulation in Alzheimer's disease: impact of a training programme. The study evaluates the efficacy of a procedural memory stimulation programme in mild and mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). Twenty basic and instrumental activities of daily living have been selected, and divided into two groups, comparable for difficulty. Ten normal elderly subjects (age 68.0 +/- 4.8 years; MMSE score: 28.7 +/- 0.9; education: 7.6 +/- 3.5 years) were asked to perform the two groups of daily activities and the time required to perform the tasks of each group was recorded and used as a reference. Ten mild and mild-moderate AD patients (age 77.2 +/- 5.3 years; MMSE score: 19.8 +/- 3.5; education: 7.3 +/- 4.7 years) without major behavioural disturbances constituted the experimental group. Patients were evaluated in all 20 daily activities and the time employed was recorded at baseline and after a 3-week training (1 h/d, 5 d/week) period. Five patients were trained during the 3 weeks on half of the 20 daily activities and the other five patients were trained on the remainder. This procedure was adopted in order to detect separately the improvement in "trained" and "not trained" activities, allowing to control better the effects of the intervention. The assessment of the functional impact of the training was directly measured, through the variation of time employed to perform tasks before and after training. After 3 weeks of training a significant improvement was observed for the trained activities, from 3.6 to 1.9 standard deviations below the performance of the normal elderly controls (P &lt; 0.05). AD patients improved also in not-trained activities from 3.5 to 2.7 standard deviations below the controls' performance (P &lt; 0.05). The rehabilitation of activities of daily living through developing procedural memory strategies may be effective in mild and mild-moderate AD patients. </text>

      <text>Regulation of p53-dependent apoptosis, transcriptional repression, and cell transformation by phosphorylation of the 55-kilodalton E1B protein of human adenovirus type 5.  The adenovirus type 5 55-kDa E1B protein (E1B-55kDa) cooperates with E1A gene products to induce cell transformation. E1A proteins stimulate DNA synthesis and cell proliferation; however, they also cause rapid cell death by p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptosis. It is believed that the role of the E1B-55kDa protein in transformation is to protect against p53-dependent apoptosis by binding to and inactivating p53. It has been shown previously that the 55-kDa polypeptide abrogates p53-mediated transactivation and that mutants defective in p53 binding are unable to cooperate with E1A in transformation. We have previously mapped phosphorylation sites near the carboxy terminus of the E1B-55kDa protein at Ser-490 and Ser-491, which lie within casein kinase II consensus sequences. Conversion of these sites to alanine residues greatly reduced transforming activity, and although the mutant 55-kDa protein was found to interact with p53 at normal levels, it was somewhat defective for suppression of p53 transactivation activity. We now report that a nearby residue, Thr-495, also appears to be phosphorylated. We demonstrate directly that the wild-type 55-kDa protein is able to block E1A-induced p53-dependent apoptosis, whereas cells infected by mutant pm490/1/5A, which contains alanine residues at all three phosphorylation sites, exhibited extensive DNA fragmentation and classic apoptotic cell death. The E1B-55kDa product has been shown to exhibit intrinsic transcriptional repression activity when localized to promoters, such as by fusion with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, even in the absence of p53. Such repression activity was totally absent with mutant pm490/1/5A. These data suggested that inhibition of p53-dependent apoptosis may depend on the transcriptional repression function of the 55-kDa protein, which appears to be regulated be phosphorylation at the carboxy terminus. </text>

      <text>Non-invasive grading of primary brain tumours: results of a comparative study between SPET with 123I-alpha-methyl tyrosine and PET with 18F-deoxyglucose. Use of iodine-123-alpha-methyl tyrosine (123I-IMT) allows investigation of the amino acid transport rate in gliomas. It was the aim of this study to compare the value of measurement of glucose metabolism with that of measurement of 123I-IMT uptake for the non-invasive grading of brain tumours. The study population comprised 23 patients with histopathologically proven primary brain tumours; 14 had high-grade gliomas, and nine low-grade brain neoplasms. Glucose metabolism was studied using an ECAT EXACT 47 positron emission tomography (PET) camera and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG); 123I-IMT uptake was measured with the triple-headed single-photon emission tomography (SPET) camera, MULTISPECT 3. 18F-FDG and 123I-IMT uptake was quantified as ratios between the uptake by the tumour and contralateral regions of reference. Glucose metabolism and amino acid uptake of the brain tumours correlated significantly (r=0.71, P &lt;0.001). Assuming discrimination thresholds between high-grade and low-grade tumours of 0.8 for 18F-FDG uptake and 1.8 for 123I-IMT uptake, the accuracy values of 18F-FDG PET and 123I-IMT SPET for differentiating between high-grade and low-grade tumours were 21/23 (91%) and 19/23 (83%), respectively. The difference in diagnostic performance was not significant on receiver operating characteristic analysis (P &gt;0.4). It is concluded that there is no major difference between the PET investigation of glucose metabolism and the less expensive SPET measurement of amino acid uptake in terms of their accuracy in evaluating the malignancy grade of primary brain tumours. This encourages the performance of further studies to analyse the potential impact of 123I-IMT SPET on the therapeutic management of patients with brain tumours. </text>

      <text>Some findings concerning beliefs about alcoholism. The beliefs that alcoholics hold about alcoholism and themselves, and the beliefs that hospital staff and other personnel hold about alcoholism, were investigated using methods derived from the repertory grid, with anonymous facial photographs as elements. Data are presented as to the degree of association of various characteristics with alcoholism for the various groups. Differences between groups, and overall changes during group psychotherapy for patients were small. The relative contribution of personal and shared aspects of belief was measured. It was found that the agreement between groups was high and closely similar to that predictable from consistencies within groups. It is concluded that there may be a very general stereotype of alcoholism, consistent with a personality disorder concept which is implicitly held even in the face of nominal acceptance of other concepts. The self constructs of alcoholics were found to be complex. In a small follow-up study of patients, there was found to be a relationship of poor outcome with tightness of construing for key constructs after psychotherapy. The implications of the findings are discussed briefly. </text>

      <text>The Wilms tumor suppressor gene WT1 induces G1 arrest and apoptosis in myeloblastic leukemia M1 cells.  WT1 was isolated as a tumor suppressor gene of Wilms tumor. However, high expression of WT1 correlates with poor prognosis in acute leukemia. In addition suppression of WT1 expression by WT1 anti-sense oligonucleotide inhibits proliferation of leukemia cells, suggesting that WT1 is important for their proliferation. To further elucidate the biological significance of WT1 in leukemic cell growth, we overexpressed exogenous WT1 in murine M1 myeloblastic leukemia cells using the isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG)-controlled expression system. We found that induction of one splicing variant of WT1 [WT1-17AA(+)-KTS(-)] in M1 cells induces cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death. These results suggest that the role of WT1 is different depending on the type of leukemia cell in which it is expressed. </text>

      <text>[Expression of metastasis suppressor gene nm23 in human hepatocellular carcinoma].  For the purpose of investigating the relationship between the metastatic potential of the tumor as well as the expression of nm23-H1 mRNA, and for determing the location of the positive sites in the cells, tumor metastasis suppressor gene nm23-H1 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (and the nonneoplastic area surrounding the tumor) was detected by in situ hybridization using digoxiginin-labeled nm23-H1 antisense complementary RNA probe. The primary results indicated (i) positive results of in situ hybridization are presence of granules or masses in the cytoplasm; (ii) the less expression of nm23-H1 mRNA, the higher metastatic rate of the human hepatocellular carcinoma (P &lt; 0.05); (iii) expression of nm23-H1 mRNA dose not correlate with some other factors such as tumor size and the background of other liver diseases. </text>

Interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) induces cytogenetic responses of variable degree in patients with CML. We sought to establish the relationship between BCR-ABL transcript numbers measured by competitive two-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and cytogenetic status in CML patients treated with IFN-alpha. All 398 samples from 163 patients investigated by RT-PCR were positive for BCR-ABL transcripts. In order to standardize results for variability in RNA and cDNA quality, we quantified total ABL transcripts in each sample as internal control. The BCR-ABL/ABL ratios correlated with the cytogenetic results. Quantitative nested PCR allowed the detection of residual BCR-ABL transcripts in all complete cytogenetic responders on IFN-alpha. We conclude that competitive PCR with internal controls is a reliable method for monitoring patients on IFN-alpha and reduces the need for repeated marrow investigations. </text>

      <text>[Treatment of acute liver failure in children]. Among the main causes of acute liver failure (ALF) in children, metabolic diseases (especially in infants), viral and toxin or drug induced hepatitis are the most frequent. The cause remains, however, undetermined in about 30% of the cases. Management must be conducted in a pediatric hepatology unit or intensive care unit in relation with a pediatric transplant team in order: 1) to perform urgent etiological diagnosis; 2) to initiate specific therapy and symptomatic treatment; 3) to evaluate the severity and prognosis of liver disease for selection of children for emergency liver transplantation; 4) to evaluate contraindications to liver transplantation. The overall survival of post-emergency liver transplantation for ALF in children averages 65%. </text>

      <text>Blind separation of auditory event-related brain responses into independent components. Averaged event-related potential (ERP) data recorded from the human scalp reveal electroencephalographic (EEG) activity that is reliably time-locked and phase-locked to experimental events. We report here the application of a method based on information theory that decomposes one or more ERPs recorded at multiple scalp sensors into a sum of components with fixed scalp distributions and sparsely activated, maximally independent time courses. Independent component analysis (ICA) decomposes ERP data into a number of components equal to the number of sensors. The derived components have distinct but not necessarily orthogonal scalp projections. Unlike dipole-fitting methods, the algorithm does not model the locations of their generators in the head. Unlike methods that remove second-order correlations, such as principal component analysis (PCA), ICA also minimizes higher-order dependencies. Applied to detected-and undetected-target ERPs from an auditory vigilance experiment, the algorithm derived ten components that decomposed each of the major response peaks into one or more ICA components with relatively simple scalp distributions. Three of these components were active only when the subject detected the targets, three other components only when the target went undetected, and one in both cases. Three additional components accounted for the steady-state brain response to a 39-Hz background click train. Major features of the decomposition proved robust across sessions and changes in sensor number and placement. This method of ERP analysis can be used to compare responses from multiple stimuli, task conditions, and subject states. </text>

      <text>CD56+ putative natural killer cell lymphomas: production of cytolytic effectors and related proteins mediating tumor cell apoptosis?  Apoptosis is a regulated form of cell death that may be triggered by natural killer (NK) or cytotoxic T cells, which effect target cell lysis by cytolytic effector and related proteins through complex intracellular signals. This study was aimed to investigate whether there is selective expression of these cytolytic markers in the putative NK-cell lymphomas and whether there is correlation with zonal tumor cell death in these tumors. Expression of the cytolytic effectors perforin, granzyme B9, and the granule membrane protein TIA1 were examined in 24 putative NK-cell lymphomas, 18 postthymic T-cell lymphomas (one case CD8+ CD56+ and three anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL), three T-lymphoblastic lymphomas, and 20 B-cell lymphomas. Nineteen (79%) putative NK-cell lymphomas expressed perforin, and all 24 cases expressed granzyme B9 and TIA1. The only CD8+ CD56+ postthymic T-cell lymphoma also expressed all three cytolytic markers, two CD8- ALCL expressed TIA1; other postthymic T-cell, T-lymphoblastic, and B-cell lymphomas were consistently negative. There was strong correlation between percentage perforin-positive cells and zonal tumor cell death. Angioinvasion, in contrast, was present only in a proportion (37%) of these lymphomas despite the frequent presence of zonal tumor cell death (71%). We propose that cytolytic effector and related proteins produced by putative NK and some CD8+ CD56+ postthymic T-cell lymphomas, probably in conjunction with other mechanisms, may effect massive tumor cell apoptosis. The frequent expression of cytolytic effector markers in the CD2+ surface CD3- CD56+ putative NK-cell lymphomas lends further support to their probable NK cell origin. </text>

      <text>[Extra-anatomic bypass from the ascending aorta to the supraceliac abdominal aorta--surgical option applied to reoperation for aortic coarctation or interruption]. The optimal approach for reoperation following repair of aortic coarctation (CoA) or interruption (IAA) remains controversial. Four patients underwent extra-anatomic bypass for restenosis after repair of CoA or IAA. The age ranged from 4 to 12 years. The initial repairs for two CoA, one type A-IAA, and one type B-IAA consisted of two grafting, one subclavian arterial turning-down aortoplasty, and one subclavian flap aortoplasty. All of them underwent during infancy. Preoperative right arm systolic pressure ranged from 140 to 190 mmHg ar rest. Through a midline sternotomy and an upper laparotmy incision, an extra-anatomic bypass from the ascending aorta to the supraceliac abdominal aorta was employed using a 12 to 18 mm tube graft. All patients survived surgeries, and their hypertension markedly improved. Our experience confirms safety and effectiveness of this option in selected young patients with re-stenosis of following repair of CoA or IAA. </text>

      <text>Effect of a mutation in the anticodon of human mitochondrial tRNAPro on its post-transcriptional modification pattern. Although the gene sequences of all 22 tRNAs encoded in the human mitochondrial genome are known, little information exists about their sequences at the RNA level. This becomes a crucial limitation when searching for a molecular understanding of the growing number of maternally inherited human diseases correlated with point mutations in tRNA genes. Here we describe the sequence of human mt-tRNAPropurified from placenta. It shows absence of editing events in this tRNA and highlights the presence of eight post-transcriptional modifications. These include T54, never found so far in an animal mt-tRNA, and m1G37, a modification known to have fundamental functional properties in a number of canonical tRNAs. Occurrence of m1G37 was further investigated in an analysis of the substrate properties of in vitro transcripts of human mt-tRNAProtowards pure Escherichia coli methylguanosine transferase. This enzyme properly methylates G37 in mt-tRNA and is sensitive to the presence of a second G at position 36, neighboring the target nucleotide for methylation. Since mutation of nt 36 was shown to be correlated with myopathy, the potential consequences of non-modification or under-modification of mt-tRNA nucleotides in expression of the particular myopathy and of mitochondrial diseases in general are discussed. </text>

      <text>Clozapine-induced agranulocytosis and thrombopenia in a patient with dopaminergic psychosis. In patients with Parkinson' disease and dopaminergic psychosis, clozapine treatment is recommended as the drug is free from extrapyramidal side effects and does not worsen motor symptoms of the underlying disease. The use of clozapine, however, is limited due to its hematotoxic side effects. For treatment of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis, granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF) are recommended. We report the case of a 72-years-old male patient with clozapine-induced agranulocytosis and thrombopenia. Neutropenia was successfully treated with G-CSF, but thrombopenia persisted and resolved spontaneously after 14 days. Bone marrow toxicity of clozapine is not restricted to white cell maturation, but may also impair thrombocytopoesis. </text>

      <text>Prophylactic thyroidectomy in MEN IIA: does the calcitonin level correlate with tumor spread?  BACKGROUND: The fate of patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia of type II A (MEN II A) is determined by medullary thyroid carcinoma, which occurs in all cases. This has led to the therapeutic concept of prophylactic thyroidectomy in affected family members with the goal of removing the thyroid before the manifestation of carcinoma. We investigated a prophylactically thyroidectomized MEN II A population to determine whether the highly specific and sensitive tumor marker calcitonin correlates with tumor spread. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with MEN II A (aged 4-24 years) who had undergone prophylactic thyroidectomy since 1990 were included in the study. Baseline and pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin levels were preoperatively determined in all cases. The indication for surgery was established on the basis of pathologic calcitonin levels in the first seven patients and on the basis of detected RET proto-oncogene mutation in the other eight patients. Bilateral central lymphadenectomy was performed in all patients in addition to thyroidectomy. RESULTS: Histology demonstrated C-cell hyperplasia in five patients (aged 4-13 years), unilateral medullary microcarcinoma in six (aged 9-17 years) and a bilateral medullary microcarcinoma in three cases (aged 17-24 years). One 9-year-old boy with bilateral microcarcinoma already had a lymph node metastasis. The mean baseline calcitonin level correlated with the histologic findings (r=0.71, P=0.003) but there was no correlation between pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin levels and histology (r=0.21, P=0.47). CONCLUSION: In MEN II A patients undergoing prophylactic thyroidectomy, baseline but not stimulated calcitonin levels already correlate with the histologic tumor stage at the stage of clinically occult C-cell hyperplasia or medullary microcarcinoma. However, biochemical screening cannot reliably discriminate the transition from C-cell hyperplasia to invasive microcarcinoma. Individuals with MEN IIA should therefore undergo early prophylactic thyroidectomy once the diagnosis is confirmed by molecular genetic testing. </text>

      <text>Induction of Ets-1 in endothelial cells during reendothelialization after denuding injury. Ets-1, a transcription factor, is induced in endothelial cells (ECs) during angiogenesis. Here, we investigated the expression of Ets-1 during reendothelialization. When a confluent monolayer of human umbilical vein endothelial cell line, ECV304, was denuded, ECV304 at the wound edge expressed Ets-1. An immunohistochemical analysis revealed that Ets-1 accumulated in migrating cells at the wound edge and returned to basal level when reendothelialization was accomplished. This induction of Ets-1 could be reproduced in in vivo denudation of rat aortic endothelium by a balloon catheter. The induction of Ets-1 in ECs after denudation was regulated transcriptionally, and humeral factors released from injured ECs might not be responsible. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activities were investigated to explore the mechanism of this induction. Although extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), and p38 were activated after denudation, the activation of ERK1 and p38 was more rapid and prominent. PD98059, a specific MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) 1 inhibitor, did not affect the induction of ets-1 mRNA, whereas SB203580, a specific p38 inhibitor, almost completely abrogated its induction. These results indicate that Ets-1 is induced in ECs after denudation through activation of p38. This induction of Ets-1 may be relevant for reendothelialization by regulating the expression of certain genes. </text>

      <text>SV40 Tag transformation of the normal invasive trophoblast results in a premalignant phenotype. I. Mechanisms responsible for hyperinvasiveness and resistance to anti-invasive action of TGFbeta.  Invasion of the uterus by first trimester human placental extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells depends on mechanisms shared by malignant cells. However, unlike tumor invasion, trophoblast invasion of the uterus is stringently controlled in situ by local molecules such as transforming growth factor (TGF)beta. Since EVT cells possess active invasion-associated genes but are nontumorigenic, our objective was to induce premalignant and then malignant phenotype into a normal EVT cell line in order to identify the molecular basis of tumor progression. Simian virus 40 large T antigen (SV40 Tag) was introduced into a normal human first trimester invasive EVT cell line, HTR8, established in our laboratory. Since the HTR8 line has a limited in vitro lifespan of 12-15 passages, SV40 Tag-transformed cells were selected on the basis of extended lifespan. A long-lived line, RSVT-2, was produced and an immortalized subclone, RSVT2/C, was further derived under a forced crisis regimen. We examined transformation-induced alterations in proliferative and invasive abilities, responses to the invasion and proliferation-regulating growth factor TGFbeta and changes in gene expression for invasion-associated enzymes or enzyme inhibitors. RSVT-2 and RSVT2/C cell lines were hyperproliferative and hyperinvasive when compared with the parental HTR8 cell line. They were also variably resistant to the anti-proliferative and anti-invasive signals from TGFbeta. Since both cell lines remained non-tumorigenic in nude mice, these properties indicate that they attained a premalignant phenotype. Both cell lines showed reduced expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases (TIMP)-1, while TIMP-2 and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-I expression was was also reduced in RSVT2/C cells, thus contributing to their hyperinvasiveness. Their resistance to the anti-invasive action of TGFbeta was explained by the failure of TGFbeta to upregulate TIMPs and PAI-I, in contrast to the TGFbeta-induced upregulation noted in parental HTR8 cells. </text>

      <text>Acylase I-catalyzed deacetylation of N-acetyl-L-cysteine and S-alkyl-N-acetyl-L-cysteines. The aminoacylase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) was identified as acylase I after purification by column chromatography and electrophoretic analysis. Rat kidney cytosol was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, and the proteins were separated by ion-exchange column chromatography, gel-filtration column chromatography, and hydrophobic interaction column chromatography. Acylase activity with NAC and N-acetyl-L-methionine (NAM), a known substrate for acylase I, as substrates coeluted during all chromatographic steps. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the protein was purified to near homogeneity and had a subunit Mr of 43 000, which is identical with the Mr of acylase I from porcine kidney and bovine liver. n-Butylmalonic acid was a slow-binding inhibitor of acylase I and inhibited the deacetylation of NAC with a Ki of 192 +/- 27 microM. These results show that acylase I catalyzes the deacetylation of NAC. The acylase I-catalyzed deacetylation of a range of S-alkyl-N-acetyl-L-cysteines, their carbon and oxygen analogues, and the selenium analogue of NAM was also studied with porcine kidney acylase I. The specific activity of the acylase I-catalyzed deacetylation of these substrates was related to their calculated molar volumes and log P values. The S-alkyl-N-acetyl-L-cysteines with short (C0-C3) and unbranched S-alkyl substituents were good acylase I substrates, whereas the S-alkyl-N-acetyl-L-cysteines with long (&gt;C3) and branched S-alkyl substituents were poLr acylase I substrates. The carbon and oxygen analogues of S-methyl-N-acetyl-L-cysteine and the carbon analogue of S-ethyl-N-acetyl-L-cysteine were poor acylase I substrates, whereas the selenium analogue of NAM was a good acylase I substrate. </text>

      <text>Expression of two type II-like tumor hexokinase RNA transcripts in cancer cell lines. To maintain an elevated glycolytic rate, cancerous or proliferating cells alter the expression pattern of rate limiting glycolytic enzymes. Since glucose phosphorylation is the first step in glycolysis, hexokinase (HK), the first rate limiting glycolytic enzyme, can play a key regulatory role in this process. A low-Km, mitochondrial type II-like tumor HK is described as the predominant form in hepatomas. However, recent identification of a high-Km glucose phosphorylating activity in a range of cancer cells prompted us to characterize glucose phosphorylating enzymes of cancer cells at the molecular level. Highly sensitive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction identifies an induction and overexpression of a type II-like tumor HK RNA in a range of cancer cell lines irrespective of tissue origin. In addition, we report here the identification of two RNA transcripts of type II-like tumor HK of approximately 5.5 and approximately 4.0 kb in these cancer cells lines, including muscle-derived L6 myoblast cells. Interestingly, under normal conditions muscle cells express only a approximately 5.5-kb type II HK RNA transcript. A significant amount of type I HK RNA was also found expressed in cancer cell lines. RNA encoding glucokinase (GK), the high-Km HK isozyme, was found only in cancer cells originating from liver and pancreas, which express GK under normal conditions. </text>

      <text>Homeobox genes in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis.  Homeobox genes have a strikingly conserved 61-amino acid sequence, encoding DNA-binding domain. Some homeobox genes, located in four clusters are designated HOX A through D, while others are known as divergent homeobox genes. Many researchers have demonstrated that hematopoietic cells express many homeobox genes. Induced over- and under-expression of these genes has been used to demonstrate their affect on some aspects of hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. Recently, knock-out mice of homeobox genes by targeted disruption have also been used to examine their hematological effect. There are examples of the aberrant expression of a homeobox gene causing leukemias in humans. In pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with t(1;19) translocation, a fusion protein is created between E2A and a homeobox gene PBX. In T-cell ALL with t(10;14) translocation, the HOX 11 gene is deregulated. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t(7;11) translocation, the HOX A9 gene is rearranged. In this review article, many functions of homeobox genes both at the early stem cell level as well as at the later stages of hematopoietic differentiation, and the leukemogenic effect of altered homeobox genes are discussed. </text>

      <text>Store-operated calcium entry promotes shape change in pulmonary endothelial cells expressing Trp1. Activation of Ca2+ entry is known to produce endothelial cell shape change, leading to increased permeability, leukocyte migration, and initiation of angiogenesis in conduit-vessel endothelial cells. The mode of Ca2+ entry regulating cell shape is unknown. We hypothesized that activation of store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOCs) is sufficient to promote cell shape change necessary for these processes. SOC activation in rat pulmonary arterial endothelial cells increased free cytosolic Ca2+ that was dependent on a membrane current having a net inward component of 5.45 +/- 0.90 pA/pF at -80 mV. Changes in endothelial cell shape accompanied SOC activation and were dependent on Ca2+ entry-induced reconfiguration of peripheral (cortical) filamentous actin (F-actin). Because the identity of pulmonary endothelial SOCs is unknown, but mammalian homologues of the Drosophila melanogaster transient receptor potential (trp) gene have been proposed to form Ca2+ entry channels in nonexcitable cells, we performed RT-PCR using Trp oligonucleotide primers in both rat and human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells. Both cell types were found to express Trp1, but neither expressed Trp3 nor Trp6. Our study indicates that 1) Ca2+ entry in pulmonary endothelial cells through SOCs produces cell shape change that is dependent on site-specific rearrangement of the microfilamentous cytoskeleton and 2) Trp1 may be a component of pulmonary endothelial SOCs. </text>

      <text>Hemispheric control of motor function: a whole brain echo planar fMRI study. The aim of this study was to explore whether recruitment of the ipsilateral motor cortex during non-dominant motor movement reflects left hemispheric control of motor function or simply the greater complexity or unfamiliarity of the motor task. BOLD fMRI was performed in normal right-handers during two motor tasks: (1) sequential finger movements (SM task) with the right or left hand; and (2) random finger movements (RM task) with the right hand. In all subjects, activation was predominantly in the contralateral motor areas (primary sensorimotor, lateral premotor, parietal and supplementary motor regions) and ipsilateral cerebellum. While the ipsilateral motor areas were also activated, single subject analysis revealed these areas to be more extensive and to be seen in more subjects during the non-dominant hand SM task and dominant hand RM task than during the more familiar dominant hand SM task. Similarly, group analysis also revealed ipsilateral activation in the primary sensorimotor and lateral premotor areas, but only during the non-dominant SM task and the dominant hand RM task. Non-dominant hand movements, perhaps because they are less 'automatic', appear to require more cortical activity similar to complex tasks with the dominant hand, and result in greater recruitment of ipsilateral cortical motor areas and striatum. The study also illustrates how potentially meaningful subtleties seen on individual maps may be obscured with group averaging approaches. </text>

      <text>Glucose and lactate metabolism in C6 glioma cells: evidence for the preferential utilization of lactate for cell oxidative metabolism. 13C and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) was used to investigate the metabolism of L-lactate and D-glucose in C6 glioma cells. The 13C enrichment of cell metabolites was examined after a 4-h incubation in media containing 5.5 mM glucose and 11 mM lactate, each metabolite being alternatively labelled with either [1-13C]D-glucose or [3-13C]L-lactate. The results indicated that exogenous lactate was the major substrate for oxidative metabolism. They were consistent with the concept of the existence of 2 pools of both lactate and pyruvate, of which 1 pool was closely connected with exogenous lactate and oxidative metabolism, and the other pool was closely related to glycolysis and disconnected from oxidative metabolism. The molecular basis of this behaviour could be related to different locations for the lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes, as suggested by their immunohistochemical labelling. </text>

      <text>Tumors of the retinal pigment epithelium metastasize to inguinal lymph nodes and spleen in tyrosinase-related protein 1/SV40 T antigen transgenic mice.  The pigment epithelium of the retina (RPE) is derived from the optic cup and is essential for function and development of the eye. We produced a transgenic mouse line that expresses simian virus (SV40) transforming sequences under control of the 1.4 kb tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TRP-1) promoter, targeting expression of T antigen (Tag) to the RPE. In transgenic embryos, RPE cells proliferated in the anterior part of the eye and near the optic nerve. This resulted in formation of tumors, which were pigmented and of epithelial origin. In 3 months-old mice, pigmented cells were detected in spleen and inguinal lymph nodes. In spleen, tyrosinase, TRP-1 and SV40 Tag were expressed and tyrosinase was enzymatically active. Pigmented regions were positive for an epithelial marker, cytokeratin. Cell lines were established from tumor and metastases and kept in culture for more than 2 months. These were pigmented, and maintained expression of tyrosinase, TRP-1, cytokeratin and SV40 Tag. This demonstrates that RPE tumor cells metastasize to lymph node and spleen. In conclusion, the metastasis from TRP-1/Tag RPE tumors towards spleen and lymph nodes serves as potential tool to investigate biology and metastasis of tumors derived from the pigment epithelium. </text>

      <text>Glucagon induces suppression of ATP-sensitive K+ channel activity through a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent pathway in mouse pancreatic beta-cells. Glucagon is known to increase intracellular cAMP levels and enhance glucose-induced electrical activity and insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cell perfused with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution. The present experiments were aimed at evaluation of the hypothesis that changes in beta-cells ATP-sensitive K+ (K(ATP)) channel activity are involved in the glucagon-induced enhancement of electrical activity. Channel activity was recorded using the cell-attached configuration of the patch-clamp technique. Addition of glucagon (2.9 x 10(-7) m) in the presence of 11.1 mm glucose caused closure of K(ATP) channels followed by an increase in the frequency of biphasic current transients (action currents) due to action potential generation in the cell. Three calmodulin-antagonists (W-7, chlorpromazine, and trifluoperazine) restored with similar efficacy K(ATP) channel activity in cells being exposed to glucagon. At 2.8 mm glucose, glucagon did not affect K(ATP) channel activity until Ca2+ was released from Nitr-5 by flash photolysis, at which point channel activity was transiently suppressed. Similar effects were seen when db-cAMP was used instead of glucagon. These results support the view that glucagon and other cAMP-generating agonists enhance glucose-induced beta-cell electrical activity through a Ca2+/calmodulin dependent-closure of K(ATP) channels. </text>

      <text>Effect of U-995, a potent shark cartilage-derived angiogenesis inhibitor, on anti-angiogenesis and anti-tumor activities. BACKGROUND: A potent angiogenesis inhibitor, U-995, has been purified from the cartilage of the blue shark (Prionace glauca). U-995 is composed of two single peptides with molecular mass of 10 and 14 kDa, respectively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: U-995 was designed to study human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) migration and proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis induced by TNF alpha in chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). Furthermore, we determined the ability of U-995 to inhibiting tumor cell growth and metastasis. RESULTS: U-995 (15 and 30 micrograms/ml) markedly inhibited HUVEC migration and, at 15-50 micrograms/ml produced a dose-dependent decline in [3H]-thymidine incorporation. 30 and 50 micrograms/ml of U-995, when added to TNF alpha-induced angiogenesis caused discontinuous and disrupted blood vessels. Moreover, U-995 (30 micrograms/ml) markedly prevented collagenase-induced collagenolysis. In addition, when 200 micrograms U-995 was injected i.p. into mice it suppressed sarcoma-180 cell growth and B16-F10 mouse melanoma cell metastasis in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the anti-angiogenic effects of U-995 may be be due to interference with the proliferation and migration of HUVECs as well as inhibition of collagenolysis, thereby leading to inhibition of both angiogenesis and tumor cell growth. </text>

      <text>Selective inhibition of the renal dopamine subtype D1A receptor induces antinatriuresis in conscious rats. Both dopamine D1-like (D1A and D1B) and D2-like (D2, D3, and D4) receptor subfamilies are present in the kidney. Blockade of the intrarenal D1-like receptor family is associated with natriuresis and diuresis. Because the D1A and D1B receptor subtypes are not distinguishable by currently available dopaminergic agents, their functional role remains undefined. In the present study, the effect of selective inhibition of the renal D1A receptor with phosphorothioated antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (AS-ODN) was investigated in conscious uninephrectomized rats. After renal interstitial administration of Texas red-labeled D1A receptor AS-ODN, intense fluorescent signal was localized in the renal tubular epithelium and vasculature. In rats on normal salt intake, AS-ODN injected interstitially into the kidney reduced daily urinary sodium excretion (1.4+/-0.04 versus 0.8+/-0.2 mEq/d, n=5, P&lt;0.05) and urine output (16.9+/-3.8 versus 12.5+/-3.6 mL/d, n=5, P&lt;0.05). In rats on high sodium intake, continuous renal interstitial administration of D1A receptor AS-ODN transiently decreased daily urinary sodium excretion (5.4+/-0.5 versus 4.2+/-0.3 mEq/d, n=7, P&lt;0.01) and urine output (27.6+/-4.5 versus 18.1+/-1.8 mL/d, n=7, P&lt;0.01). Neither vehicle nor sense oligodeoxynucleotide had significant effects. Systolic blood pressure remained unchanged. The renal D1A receptor protein was significantly decreased by 35% and 46% at the end of the study in AS-ODN-treated rats on normal and high salt intake, respectively, whereas the D1B receptor and beta-actin were not affected. These results provide the first direct evidence that the renal D1A receptor subtype plays an important role in the control of sodium excretion. </text>
